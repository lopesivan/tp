   1. install webalizer

          sudo apt-get install webalizer

      If webalizer is not found, you have to add sources in /etc/apt/sources.list: can comment the universe sources.
   2. Enable the apache2 hostname resolution: go into /etc/apache2/apache2.conf: Change

    HostnameLookups Off

into

    HostnameLookups On

   1. By default webalizer is not well configured: it does not check in the good log. In /etc/webalizer.conf: Change

          LogFile         /var/log/apache/access.log.1

      to

          LogFile         /var/log/apache2/access.log

   2. Test webalizer:

          sudo webalizer

      If you get a warning like warning: Truncating …
      It is because you did not put the hostnameLookup. If afterward, you get this message, it can be because you are attacked by a virus…
   3. Run webalizer as a cronjob. This has to be run as root: Edit the root cronjobs by running the command:

          sudo crontab -e

      and add the line:

          0 * * * * webalizer
