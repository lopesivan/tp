Look like several solutions: one short term and one long term.
http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=37056 recommend:
2 reboots (probably it will check and fix vfat) or manually fix vfat:
1. reboot
2. open x-term
3. type root (you will need rootsh package from Extras)
4. type umount /home/user/MyDocs
5. type fsck -a /dev/mmcblk0p1
6. reboot
