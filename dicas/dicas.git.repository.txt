Hosting Git repositories, The Easy (and Secure) Way

Posted: November 14, 2007, by garry
Tags: git hosting

Update (08-10-2008): For topics not covered here, I encourage everyone to read
the gitosis README, bundled with the distribution. There is also an
example.conf configuration file that illustrates more features than I have
covered here.

I have been asked more and more these days, "How do I host a Git repository?"
Usually it is assumed that some access control beyond simply read-only is
involved (some users have commit rights). With access control comes issues of
security, and that's a whole other bag of cats. This post is about presenting
an answer to this question, without the fuss.

The rest of this article will be a tutorial showing you how to host and manage
Git repositories with access control, easily and safely. I use an up and coming
tool called gitosis that my friend Tv wrote to help make hosting git repos
easier and safer. It manages multiple repositories under one user account,
using SSH keys to identify users. However, users do *not* need shell accounts
on the server, instead they will talk to one shared account that does not allow
arbitrary commands. Git itself is used to setup gitosis and manage the Git
repos, which pleases the recursion-seeking orthogonal CS-side of my brain.

Assumptions: I take my examples from a Ubuntu Linux server. While I haven't
tested other systems, I imagine different Linux distributions, FreeBSD, OS X,
etc... would be similar. Gitosis is written in Python, so you should have a
copy of Python installed as well.

Enough talk, let's get down and dirty.

Install gitosis

gitosis is a tool for hosting git repositories (I'm repeating myself for those
who skim :)

The first thing to do is grab a copy of gitosis and install it on your server:

cd ~/src
git clone git://eagain.net/gitosis.git

Notice that gitosis is extremely light-weight. The clone takes a mere couple
seconds. Less is more, and I like that a lot.

Next, install it like so:

cd gitosis
python setup.py install

Don't use --prefix unless you like self-inflicted pain. It is possible to
install gitosis in a non-standard location, but it's not nice. Read the Caveats
section at the bottom and then come back here.

If you get this error:

-bash: python: command not found

or

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "setup.py", line 2, in ?
    from setuptools import setup, find_packages
ImportError: No module named setuptools

You have to install Python setuptools. On Debian/Ubuntu systems, it's just:

sudo apt-get install python-setuptools

For other systems, someone tell me or leave a comment, so I can update this
section and improve this tutorial.

The next thing to do is to create a user that will own the repositories you
want to manage. This user is usually called git, but any name will work, and
you can have more than one per system if you really want to. The user does not
need a password, but does need a valid shell (otherwise, SSH will refuse to
work).

sudo adduser \
    --system \
    --shell /bin/sh \
    --gecos 'git version control' \
    --group \
    --disabled-password \
    --home /home/git \
    git

You may change the home path to suit your taste. A successful user creation
will look similar to:

Adding system user `git'...
Adding new group `git' (211).
Adding new user `git' (211) with group `git'.
Creating home directory `/home/git'.

You will need a public SSH key to continue. If you don't have one, you may
generate one on your local computer:

ssh-keygen -t rsa

The public key will be in $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. Copy this file to your server
(the one running gitosis).

Next we will run a command that will sprinkle some magic into the home
directory of the git user and put your public SSH key into the list of
authorized keys.

sudo -H -u git gitosis-init < /tmp/id_rsa.pub

id_rsa.pub above is your public SSH key that you copied to the server. I
recommend you put it in /tmp so the git user won't have permission problems
when trying to read it. Success looks like:

Initialized empty Git repository in ./
Initialized empty Git repository in ./

(Yes, two times)

For good measure, let's make sure the post-update hook is set executable. I've
seen it where sometimes it doesn't get set (problem with older setuptools):

sudo chmod 755 /home/git/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/hooks/post-update

Here some cool magic happens. Run this on your local machine:

git clone git@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME:gitosis-admin.git
cd gitosis-admin

You will now have a gitosis.conf file and keydir/ directory:

~/dev/gitosis-admin (master) $ ls -l
total 8
-rw-r--r--   1 garry  garry  104 Nov 13 05:43 gitosis.conf
drwxr-xr-x   3 garry  garry  102 Nov 13 05:43 keydir/

This repository that you just cloned contains all the files (right now, only 2)
needed to create repositories for your projects, add new users, and defined
access rights. Edit the settings as you wish, commit, and push. Once pushed,
gitosis will immediately make your changes take effect on the server. So we're
using Git to host the configuration file and keys that in turn define how our
Git hosting behaves. That's just plain cool.

From this point on, you don't need to be on your server. All configuration
takes place locally and you push the changes to your server when you're ready
for them to take effect.

Creating new repositories

This is where the fun starts. Let's create a new repository to hold our project
codenamed FreeMonkey.

Open up gitosis.conf and notice the default configuration:

[gitosis]

[group gitosis-admin]
writable = gitosis-admin
members = jdoe

Your "members" line will hold your key filename (without the .pub extension)
that is in keydir/. In my example, it is "jdoe", but for you it'll probably be
a combination of your username and hostname.

To create a new repo, we just authorize writing to it and push. To do so, add
this to gitosis.conf:

[group myteam]
members = jdoe
writable = free_monkey

This defines a new group called "myteam", which is an arbitrary string. "jdoe"
is a member of myteam and will have write access to the "free_monkey" repo.

Save this addition to gitosis.conf, commit and push it:

git commit -a -m "Allow jdoe write access to free_monkey"
git push

Now the user "jdoe" has access to write to the repo named "free_monkey", but we
still haven't created a repo yet. What we will do is create a new repo locally,
and then push it:

mkdir free_monkey
cd free_monkey
git init
git remote add origin git@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME:free_monkey.git

# do some work, git add and commit files

git push origin master:refs/heads/master

With the final push, you're off to the races. The repository "free_monkey" has
been created on the server (in /home/git/repositories) and you're ready to
start using it like any ol' git repo.

Adding users

The next natural thing to do is to grant some lucky few commit access to the
FreeMonkey project. This is a simple two step process.

First, gather their public SSH keys, which I'll call "alice.pub" and "bob.pub",
and drop them into keydir/ of your local gitosis-admin repository. Second, edit
gitosis.conf and add them to the "members" list.

cd gitosis-admin
cp ~/alice.pub keydir/
cp ~/bob.pub keydir/
git add keydir/alice.pub keydir/bob.pub

Note that the key filename must have a ".pub" extension.

gitosis.conf changes:

 [group myteam]
- members = jdoe
+ members = jdoe alice bob
  writable = free_monkey

Commit and push:

git commit -a -m "Granted Alice and Bob commit rights to FreeMonkey"
git push

That's it. Alice and Bob can now clone the free_monkey repository like so:

git clone git@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME:free_monkey.git

Alice and Bob will also have commit rights.

Public access

If you are running a public project, you will have your users with commit
rights, and then you'll have everyone else. How do we give everyone else
read-only access without fiddling w/ SSH keys?

We just use git-daemon. This is independent of gitosis and it comes with git
itself.

sudo -u git git-daemon --base-path=/home/git/repositories/ --export-all

This will make all the repositories you manage with gitosis read-only for the
public. Someone can then clone FreeMonkey like so:

git clone git://YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME/free_monkey.git

To export only some repositories and not others, you need to touch
git-daemon-export-ok inside the root directory (e.g. /home/git/repositories/
free_monkey.git) of each repo that you want public. Then remove "--export-all"
from the git-daemon command above.

More tricks

gitosis.conf can be set to do some other neat tricks. Open example.conf in the
gitosis source directory (where you originally cloned gitosis way at the top)
to see a summary of all options. You can specify some repos to be read-only
(opposite of writable), but yet not public. A group members list can include
another group. And a few other tricks that I'll leave it to the reader to
discover.

Caveats

If /home/git/.gitosis.conf on your server never seems to get updated to match
your local copy (they should match), even though you are making changes and
pushing, it could be that your post-update hook isn't executable. Older
versions of setuptools can cause this. Be sure to fix that:

sudo chmod 755 /home/git/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/hooks/post-update

If your Python goodies are in a non-standard location, you must additionally
edit post-update and put an "export PYTHONPATH=..." line at the top. Failure to
do so will give you a Python stack trace the first time you try to push changes
within gitosis-admin.

If you want to install gitosis in a non-standard location, I don't recommend
it. It's an edge case that the author hasn't run up against until I bugged him
to help me get it working.

For the brave, you need to edit whatever file on your system controls the
default PATH for a non-login, non-interactive shell. On Ubuntu this is /etc/
environment. Add the path to gitosis-serve to the PATH line. Also insert a line
for PYTHONPATH and set it to your non-standard Python site-packages directory.
As an example, this is my /etc/environment:

PATH="/home/garry/sys/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/games"
PYTHONPATH=/home/garry/sys/lib/python2.4/site-packages

Be sure to logout and log back in after you make these changes.

Don't use the gitosis-init line I have above for the standard install, instead
use this slightly modified one:

sudo -H -u git env PATH=$PATH gitosis-init < /tmp/id_rsa.pub

Be sure to also set PYTHONPATH in your post-update hook as described above.

The *should* do it. I am purposefully terse with this non-standard setup as I
think not many people will use it. HIt me up in #git on FreeNode if you need
more info (my nick is up_the_irons).

Non-standard SSH port

If you run SSH on a non-standard port on your server, don't use the syntax
"git@myserver.com:1234:/foo/bar", it won't work. Putting the port in the URL
doesn't seem to make gitosis, or git, (not sure which) happy. Instead, put this
in your ~/.ssh/config file:

Host myserver.com
  Port 1234

Conclusion

Well, I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and that it makes your Git hosting life
easier. This is public revision 10. Please let me know if you find mistakes,
omissions, an easier way than what I described, etc...

Git it on...

(yeah, that was bad...)

awesome, i’m glad you wrote this blog post, because i have some repos to host
and i assume gitosis is still sparsely documented (i shouldn’t assume, i should
just clone it RIGHT NOW)

topfunky on November 14, 2007 09:26 AM

I had been wondering about how to implement such a system. I’m using the
git-shell on some accounts, but this will make it possible to restrict projects
to certain users.

Even so, I’m looking forward to the upcoming GitHub which will make public and
private Git hosting much easier, for only a small monthly fee (with a more
attractive interface than gitweb).

grempe on November 14, 2007 01:08 PM

Great writeup.

I am excited about Gitosis. Sounds like a great way to host Git repos. I had
issues with installing it though on my Ubuntu 7.04 system though. I chatted
with Tv on IRC and it appears there may be a problem with Git binaries
installed in ‘non-standard’ locations. I think non-standard means it was
installed using something other than ‘sudo apt-get install git-core’. My Git is
compiled and installed from source in the /usr/local/bin dir and you’ll get an
error like the one found in this pastie:

http://git.pastebin.com/f7884e0be

According to Tv (the author) on IRC:

Tv: glenn: it seems your git is installed outside of the normal PATH for your
system [11:35am] glenn: hmmm… ok, its in /usr/local/bin/git [11:36am] Tv:
glenn: that case is a known problem for gitosis, right now; even if you could
get through init, you’ll have trouble later

Just trying to save some people some time. Better to wait for a bugfix from Tv
if you are in this situation. His blog is: http://eagain.net/blog

Cheers.

Garry on November 14, 2007 03:16 PM

grempe,

Yup, that’s a known issue. If you apply the patch in my Caveats section and
then make sure your PATH gets exported (ala /etc/environment, etc…) correctly,
you will be able to get it working. My git is in /home/garry/sys/bin and
gitosis finds it after I applied the patch (which basically just passes PATH to
subprocesses).

Garry on November 14, 2007 03:19 PM

thedaniel,

Actually README.rst of gitosis ain’t bad :)

topfunky,

You’re gonna have to tell me more about this new GitHub…!

mat on November 14, 2007 09:48 PM

Just a quick comment from… “The public key will be in $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
Copy this file to your server.”

I was a little confused with “Copy this file to your server.” o were you
talking about the git server or some ssh key server o if the latter, how do you
do that

These answers might make the tutorial a little more clear, even if its a
pointer off to some other page that explains it.

Otherwise, great entry. This seems like the perfect time for this post as git
is gaining momentum with the masses.

-mat

Garry on November 15, 2007 12:38 AM

Hi mat,

I’ve added “the server running gitosis” to that text. Thanks for the
suggestion.

Garry on November 15, 2007 02:19 AM

Note to readers who’ve come back for more—

I’ve made updates tonight since my original post. I included a small patch as a
part of the regular setup. It helps gitosis find git if you have git installed
in a non-standard location (let subprocesses see your modified PATH). Also, it
fixes a BIG show stopper git-checkout-index error if you run git 1.5.3 and
higher (which I highly recommend) on your server. No issue was seen with git
1.5.2.x and lower.

Thanks to Tv and spearce in #git for the help.

Garry on November 15, 2007 03:25 AM

SSH tip:

If you run SSH on a non-standard port and can’t get the clone to work, put
something like this in your ~/.ssh/config: http://p.caboo.se/118289

Change hostname and port.

Now all your other apps that use SSH on that server benefit too :)

cactus on November 15, 2007 05:59 AM

It ‘appears’ based on the config presented in this article, that you are
granting people ssh access to the git user (pubkey auth), while using /bin/sh
(possibly aliased to bash) as the default shell.

This would give any user added as a ‘git user’ full shell access to that
account. I am curious why you are not using the git-shell as the shell for that
user instead.

Garry on November 15, 2007 12:04 PM

cactus,

It does not give a full shell, because in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys we use
“command=”

This makes SSH execute only that command, you can’t get a login shell.

Tv on November 15, 2007 12:11 PM

I’ve fixed the caveats mentioned here, if someone in the audience had trouble,
please try with the latest version.

If you install gitosis outside of the usual PYTHONPATH, you will still need to
add the containing directory to it, before running gitosis-init and for the
incoming SSH sessions. This is a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem to try to
solve within gitosis, so you should just make sure the environment is correct
before gitosis is run. If anyone has a really neat solution for that, please
let me know.

Garry on November 15, 2007 03:15 PM

Thanks Tv.

I’ve removed instructions to apply my patch, as the fixes are now in master.
Awesome!

Dren on November 16, 2007 01:34 PM

This is great. Does anyone know why I would get:

fatal: Not a git repository: ’.’

when I try to push gitosis-admin? A added a line to repository.py, it says the
path argument is ’./gitosis-export’. This exists in ~/repositories/
gitosis-admin.git, but is empty.

Garry on November 16, 2007 04:38 PM

Dren,

Not sure. What git version are you using? I recommend 1.5.3 or higher on both
your local box and the server. Hit me up in #git on FreeNode, we can work
through it. My nick is up_the_irons. Then you can post your solution back here
for others who might be having the same prob.

Garry on November 17, 2007 12:17 AM

If your gitosis head is: 5bd5bd5bfcf6215e7120f12ed68118667c762c79

You’ll need this patch: http://p.caboo.se/119084

Fixes an error about generate_fp when issuing gitosis-init

Garry on November 17, 2007 01:58 AM

Dren,

I now get the error you are getting too. I’ve informed Tv and he’s working on
it.

grempe on November 17, 2007 06:29 PM

Just following up on my own post above where I had some issues. With the latest
updates I pulled from gitosis today I was able to finally build, install, and
init gitosis on Ubuntu 7.0.4. I am up and running and thinking that this is a
great tool so far. Definitely fills a nitch. Thanks Tv and Garry. I hope all my
installation quirks are behind us now. :-)

Now I just have to stop associating the name gitosis with ‘halitosis’. :-)

Cheers.

grempe on November 19, 2007 02:37 PM

I am using gitosis now for my projects and trying to get everything working
together nicely. Can you elaborate on how we should best integrate gitweb and
git-daemon with gitosis?

I am using both tools, however I have seen no impact to using the config
settings shown in the example.conf file:

 1. Allow gitweb to show all known repositories. If you want gitweb,
     1. you need either this or a [repo foo] section for each repository
     2. you want visible in gitweb. gitweb = no

 1. Allow git-daemon to publish all known repositories. As with gitweb,
 2. this can be done globally or per-repository. daemon = no

The gitweb.py file also makes reference to using:

$projects_list = ”/path/to/your/projects.list”;

Is it intended that this file would be auto-generated by gitosis? I have not
been able to find it in any of the dirs under /home/git/.

Lastly, is there a way to have gitweb serve public repositories openly, yet
require basic auth for private repositories? Since both public and private
repos are now colocated in the same dir, and differentiated by gitosis and ssh
permissions it would be nice to allow gitweb for private repos for those users
who have permissions to see them.

Thanks!

Garry on November 20, 2007 02:27 AM

grempe

git-daemon does not necessarily integrate with gitosis, it just runs along side
gitosisnand allows read-only public access to the repos you choose. that said,
changes to gitosis since the time of writing this tutorial have made progress
in allowing you to control git-daemon and gitweb settings from gitosis. That’s
very cool, and you’ll see examples of how to do that in example.conf. As for
projects.list, i’m not sure what that does.

To use basic auth on some repos, i think you need to edit the lighttpd.conf for
gitweb, there’s not a way to do that directly in gitosis

Tv on November 25, 2007 02:40 PM

I added instruction how to integrate with git-daemon and gitweb into the
gitosis repository. Have fun.

sr on December 28, 2007 10:39 PM

This is freaking awesome! I think I’ll even switch from mercurial to git just
for gitosis Sadly gitosis won’t works. Everything goes fine until the clone
step.

[[[ % git clone git@bearnaise.net:gitosis-admin.git Initialized empty Git
repository in /home/simon/gitosis-admin/.git

^C (after 1 minute) % ]]]

And that’s all. Nothing happens and ~/gitosis-admin is empty.

Any idea?

franky on January 02, 2008 10:03 PM

Is it possible to enable only read acess to different repositories for each
one. Not the git-damon way, since it exposes the same set of repositories for
every one.

Garry on January 03, 2008 05:44 PM

@franky, I’m not sure. I use gitosis for read/write and git-daemon for
anonymous read-only.

Garry on January 09, 2008 12:03 AM

@sr, It looks something isn’t allowing you to establish an SSH connection to
your server (it’s hanging). Contact up_the_irons (me) or Tv in #git (freenode)
if you need further help.

Galen on January 10, 2008 11:17 AM

@gary: For the gentoo linux fans among us, the python setuptools package can be
emerged as follows:

emerge python-dev/setuptools

Cheers!

Hi,

Congratulations for this post about git hosting it was exactly what I was

Stu on January 23, 2008 07:36 PM

the thing that screwed me over most was not realising there was [repo blah] and
[group blah] and wondering why gitosis wasnt adding gitweb to projects.list..
since all I had was [group blahs]... sigh…

streamkid on January 31, 2008 01:00 PM

And on gentoo, python setup tools are dev-python/setuptools :-)

ChrisB on February 09, 2008 12:58 AM

Thanks for the writeup. I’ve run into a problem when I try to clone the
gitosis-admin repository on my local machine. From what I can tell, it has to
do with the git user being a “system” user. When they are a system user, I
cannot ssh in. If it’s a non-system user, then I can setup an authorized_keys
file with a command nearly the same as the git one and the general
functionality seems to work. So, I’m wondering, is it required that the git
user is a “system” user, or, is there something in my SSH daemon configuration
that can allow this? I have the git user allowed explicitly, but that still
doesn’t work, so it seems to revolve around this “system” user aspect.

ChrisB on February 10, 2008 09:23 AM

I should note, in regard to the system user issue… I’m on Ubuntu 7.10. From
what I can derive, I don’t really need the user to be a “system” user. That
would add a level of security in that they are not allowed an interactive shell
/session, but unless someone hacked past SSH+public key+command=, it’s not too
big a deal right, or am I missing a more significant security aspect that
covers?

Garry on February 12, 2008 02:10 AM

ChrisB, the “system” aspect of the adduser command makes the user in a certain
UID range and group of “nogroup”. According to the man page, it also makes it
so “logins [are] disabled”.

The Ubuntu 6.06 man page also states that logins are disabled, however I had no
problems with the git user being a “system” user. I haven’t tried installing
gitosis on 7.10 yet.

So I’d say leave off—system to adduser if it’s not working for ya.

mtkd on March 20, 2008 11:58 AM

I had issues getting this to work on a vanilla Ubuntu server install.

When I did “git clone git@ULAMP1:gitosis-admin.git” from the client, it
prompted for a password then gave a Permission Denied.

When I checked /var/log/auth.log:

User git from xxxx not allowed because not listed in AllowUsers

I added the users to AllowUsers but still had the issue, doubled checked
everything, it turned out I needed to add the user to a Group and then the
Group to AllowGroups (I used Webmin to add the user to the group and restart
SSH).

gebi on March 31, 2008 01:43 PM

few hints and fixes for gitosis on debian and maybe ubuntu too.

http://gebi.supersized.org/archives/4-Installing-gitosis-on-debian.html

bws on April 10, 2008 11:29 AM

After installing on Ubuntu, the clone of gitosis-admin was asking for a
password.

/var/log/auth.log said that

sshd^878: User git not allowed because account is locked

Changing the ! to a * in /etc/shadow fixed the problem.

leed25d on April 12, 2008 11:32 AM

,[DEL:—:DEL] | id_rsa.pub above is your public SSH key that you copied to the |
server. I recommend you put it in /tmp so the git user won’t have | permission
problems when trying to read it. Success looks like: `[DEL:—:DEL]

I believe that this is a somewhat bad idea. Some systems can be, and frequently
are, configured to clear the contents of /tmp at boot time.

pzingg on April 14, 2008 10:48 PM

On my setup (git server is OS X 10.5 Server, with git-core installed via
macports and gitosis installed using OS X’s python 2.5; git client is OS X
10.4), I had to edit the .ssh/authorized_keys file to use a path:

command=”/usr/local/bin/gitosis-serve user@host”, ...

Otherwise I would get this when trying to do the remote git clone:

bash: gitosis-serve: command not found fatal: The remote end hung up
unexpectedly fetch-pack from ‘git@gitserver.example.com:gitosis-admin.git’
failed.

I also put the path to the macports area (/opt/local/bin) into the .bashrc in
the git server’s git user’s home directory, so that the git-xxx commands would
be found.

silent (e) on April 15, 2008 10:25 AM

Is there something different in the way this would work on Windows (as a
client). I’ve installed gitosis on my FreeBSD 6.x server and am able to run the
“git clone git://server:repositories/gitosis-admin.git” command. I have a “git”
user (for which I wasn’t able to set up a blank password. passable unix fu).
The git command asks for the git user password, which I enter correctly. My
conf file shows this for the gitosis-admin group

[group gitosis-admin] writable = gitosis-admin members = matte@laptop

But the computer I’m running the command from is member “matte@pc”. My
understanding is that gitosis shouldn’t allow me to write because that member
isn’t specified. However, I am able to read and write to the “gitosis-admin”
project.

Is it because I have a password on the “git” user and it authenticates with the
password I set? Is it because windows (stuck with it for now) doesn’t have a
personally identifiable user ssh key?

Technically I haven’t seen how to set up a personal ssh key for my account
outside of using PuTTY’s Pagaent program… which I’m running. But it has my
matte@pc public key. Which isn’t specified in the config file.

it doesn’t depend on running the git-daemon does it? I set that up too but I
can’t open up projects right now, so I disabled it.

Thanx in advance. Email me if you’d like to take this outta the comments.

Garry on April 15, 2008 04:24 PM

@leed25d, the pubkey only has to be there temporarily, hence /tmp :) It doesn’t
matter if it is cleared at boot time, you won’t need it any more.

Garry on April 15, 2008 04:28 PM

@silent(e), gitosis was meant for SSH key auth only. If Windows cannot identify
a key to a user and you’re using passwords instead, the results are unknown. It
wouldn’t depend on git-daemon though.

@lazz: if you are on ubuntu (or any debian flavor), you can enable the backport
repositories for apt-get, then run ‘apt-get install git-core’ or ‘sudo apt-get
update && sudo apt-get upgrade’ and it will update git to 1.5.5.4.

BTW, I tried to compile git from source on Fiesty and had no luck.

No problems since.

Garry on April 21, 2008 12:16 AM

@lazz, you should upgrade your git :)

Lobo tuerto on April 24, 2008 09:27 PM

@garry:

Excelent post, it helped me lots. I have two questions.

1. Can I make a spanish translation of this article to post it in my blog? (I
will link back and give credit). 2. After I set up my repository, I pushed a
new branch into it. How do I delete a branch from my repo? do I need to just
delete the /home/git/repositories/nameofmyrepo.git/refs/heads/
nameofbranchtodelete? or what would be the correct way to do it?

Thank you.

Garry on April 25, 2008 12:47 PM

@Lobo tuerto,

1. You can make a spanish translation, no problem. That’d be great for the
Spanish speaking community.

2. To delete a branch, you do:

“git push origin :branch_to_delete”

Lobo tuerto on April 25, 2008 06:24 PM

@Garry:

Thank you!

Jim on April 28, 2008 01:43 PM

Thanks for the post Garry.

I have successfully got gitosis installed on Ubuntu 8.04 Server (64bit) in a
VMWare virtual machine on VMWare Fusion on my Mac (running Leopard). I have
followed all the steps exactly but I seem to have an issue with the ssh key.

Annoyingly, each time I “git push origin master:refs/heads/master” I am
prompted for the passphrase. The same key has been installed in my normal
user’s /home/jim/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the same Ubuntu Server and works
fine for ssh’ing from the Mac as user jim. The key seems to have been added
correctly to /home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys:

 1. autogenerated by gitosis, DO NOT EDIT command=”gitosis-serve jim@<hostname>
    ”,no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-pty ssh-rsa
    AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAA…continued…5U76Bx70ltT87oQK7sbEXk9pYf1Ux6cKRehYsEQ5kTOTo2UqO8H52a
    /FIrROPhd6G8Q== tim@<hostname>

I’m a n00b when it comes to ssh keys. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.

Jim on April 28, 2008 01:48 PM

edit ^^^: the last part of the key is jim@<hostname> but I guess that’s just
the comment and not important ;)

Garry on April 30, 2008 03:49 AM

@Jim, so you were able to clone and push/pull the gitosis-admin repo? It’s the
new repo you created with gitosis that is having issues, no?

Jim on April 30, 2008 07:06 AM

@Garry, no I have to enter the passphrase when pushing the gitosis-admin too.
Do I need to set up ssh-agent to manage the key authentication. I haven’t
needed this when ssh’ing (perhaps that it stored in the Mac accounts keychain?)

solo on April 30, 2008 01:31 PM

Here’s what I had to do to get the prerequisites on RHEL5:

rpm -ivh http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/i386/
epel-release-5-2.noarch.rpm yum install python-setuptools

Hope this helps—

Solomon

solo on April 30, 2008 10:19 PM

@Garry: I’ve followed the instructions above, and the gitosis-admin part seems
to work—I can add a public key to my local repo, commit and push to my server
repo, and verify that the ~git/.ssh/authorized_keys is changed with the new
login info, etc. However, when I try git clone’ing another repo managed by
gitosis, I get the following error:

  • [err] Address xx.xx.xx.xx maps to ip-xx.xx.xx.xx.hostingcompany.net, but
    this does not map back to the address – POSSIBLE BREAK-IN ATTEMPT!

  • [err] fatal: ‘repo.git’: unable to chdir or not a git archive

  • [err] fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly

  • [err] fetch-pack from ‘git@xx.xx.xx.xx:repo.git’ failed.

The clone is being executed on the git server by a user that I have configured
in gitosis-admin to have readonly access for that repo. I tried with writable
access as well, but get the same error. Any ideas on how to troubleshoot this?

Thanks in advance,

Solomon

solo on May 01, 2008 07:17 AM

Okay, got it. My ~/git/.ssh/authorized_keys file already had the deployment
user’s key before I added it with gitosis, and the two conflicted. I removed
the offending key, and git clone is happy now.

JB on May 03, 2008 02:06 PM

Thanks. This works nice!

Richie on May 05, 2008 01:04 PM

just set this up on Debian sid. perhaps these notes can be used to supplement
your article. The user ‘gitosis’ is used instead and will get created
automatically, but it will not create the home dir. After installation I did:
mkdir /home/gitosis chown gitosis:gitosis gitosis usermod -d /home/gitosis
gitosis

Additionaly /gitosis/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/hooks/post-update is a
symlink to /usr/share/python-support/gitosis/gitosis-0.2-py2.5.egg/gitosis/
templates/admin/hooks/post-update so I ran chmod 755 on that actual file.

I’m also using mysysgit for the Windows clients: http://code.google.com/p/
msysgit/downloads/list The ssh private key went into C:\Documents and Settings\
<username>\.ssh

kino on May 12, 2008 03:49 AM

Thank’s for you work. gitosis save many hours in my life!

martin on May 13, 2008 03:18 AM

Does anyone know how to make gitweb show the repositories managed with gitosis?
All the repos are owned by user ‘git’ and group ‘git’ and gitosis makes them
not readable, writable or executable by default. This is probably the reason
why the gitweb.cgi does not list them, no matter if I work with projects.list
and “gitweb=yes” or not. When I chmod the repo directories manually to
executable (chmod o+x repo.git) it works fine. But of course I don’t want to
log in as root and set that manually each time a repo is created…. Does anyone
know a solution? Thanks for your help. —Martin

martin on May 13, 2008 07:31 AM

And another question: How can I delete a complete repository from my git-server
using gitosis-admin without having/using root-access to delete it manually?
Thanks again, Martin

Ford on May 17, 2008 05:16 AM

git push Everything up-to-date error: failed to push some refs to
‘git@host:xxx.git’

when i use the repository added newly,and push it to the gitosis server,there
is always a error: error: failed to push some refs to ‘git@host:xxx.git’ and
the contents had committed to the server.

alessio on May 20, 2008 02:51 AM

I’ve tried it more than once, but at the command: git clone
git@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME:gitosis-admin.git

it asks me about the “git” user password. I followed the tutorial more than
once, can’t see what I’m doing wrong.. Nobody experienced this?

srand on May 22, 2008 12:41 AM

Hi Folks, I have tried the installation instructions several time on several
machines and on my 64 bit machines it always fail on the following command
“sudo -H -u git gitosis-init < /tmp/id_rsa.pub”. I get the same error on
different 64 bit machines (see http://pastie.org/201406). On my ubuntu gutsy
and hardy (all 64 bit machines) machine I get the error of above. On a hardy
i386 machine everything went fine and works well. Some suggestions?

srand on May 29, 2008 10:15 AM

So Folks, problem solved. It had something to do with my public key. I
generated a new one and everything worked perfectly. So thanks for the great
how-to!! :-)

walt on May 29, 2008 01:18 PM

Hi,

great tool (by the looks – I’m not done yet, though) :)

On Fedora FC8xen I did yum install python-setuptools and was good to go

cheers, walt

Alterscape on May 29, 2008 10:37 PM

Thanks for the great tutorial! I’m trying to set up gitosis on OS X 10.4.11. I
installed pythonmac.org’s Python 2.5 build and successfully installed following
the instructions at http://blog.ardes.com/2008/5/19/git-hosting-with-leopard. I
can successfully clone, edit, commit and push the gitosis-admin repository, but
when I try to create a test_project, I get the following error on push:

$ git push ERROR:gitosis.serve.main:Repository read access denied fatal: The
remote end hung up unexpectedly

my gitosis.conf’s entry for the project looks like: [group test] writable =
test_project members = @gitosis-admin

and I used

git remote add origin git@MY_SERVER:test_project.git

to add the remote.

Thoughts?

Alex on June 01, 2008 10:17 AM

Alterscape: I had the same problem after changing the name of the key for my
first user, you might have a look there.

I solved it restarting the tutorial from the git user account creation.

Good luck :)

anthony on June 04, 2008 07:26 PM

alessio: I have had this trouble, and it was created by an out-of-sync ssh
public key. Solo’s comment above helped me out.

There are three places the key is stored. Make sure that the key at ”~/.ssh/
id_rsa.pub” on your local computer (this is the original) is in agreement with
the keys on the gitosis server:

”/home/git/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/gitosis-export/keydir/YourUsername@
YourHostname.pub” and in ”/home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys”

Rodrigo on June 11, 2008 06:36 PM

Great tutorial! Everything worked as expected, thanks a lot.

One question though: is it possible to make gitosis work with non-bare
repositories?

I ask because we use Redmine (www.redmine.org) to manage our projects, and
although it can work with bare repositories (tracking commits, etc), it won’t
let us “browse” the project files (from it’s web inteface) on a bare
repository. Any clues?

Garry on June 13, 2008 03:00 PM

@Rodrigo, I’m not sure if gitosis will work with non-bare repos. Hop in IRC and
ask “Tv” in #git, he’s the author and can probably clear that up.

Rodrigo on June 17, 2008 10:27 AM

@Garry, thanks, I talked to Tv on IRC, and he basically said the same thing,
gitosis currently expects to handle only bare repositories. But he did give me
some clues on how to get Redmine to work with bare repos, he thinks it’s
Redmine that’s doing something wrong. So I’m trying to approch this from the
other end now :)

Stu on June 18, 2008 06:05 AM

I run redmine with git no problem, I have a hook that updates a local checkout.
Redmines git adapter doesnt work with a bare .git repo it needs a proper
checkout. on post-update i just do a git pull, which since its a local repo
doesnt use any more space since it maps to the master .git repo.

in my post-update before the update server info I call /bin/sh /home/git/
repositories/project.git/hooks/update_local_repo.sh

and that script looks like;

!/bin/sh

cd /home/git/checkout/project || exit unset GIT_DIR git pull /home/git/
repositories/project.git/ master

I also have a cron job that updates redmines repositories every 30 minutes
rather than each time a user hits the repo and having redmine check for updates
(slow). (ruby script/runner “Repository.fetch_changesets” -e production)

Stu on June 18, 2008 06:06 AM

mm line breaks didnt come through. ohwell.

Anlek on June 19, 2008 10:54 PM

Thanks for the info, I have one issue though, I’ve been able to clone the
gitosis-admin without an issue, I can change it and push it back up to the
server.

I also created a new project and tried to upload it, followed all your steps
but when I try to “git push origin master:refs/heads/master” it requests a
password. Now everything else works via SSH but this, and I don’t know whats
wrong.

Any one out there can help?

DrMark on June 25, 2008 07:10 PM

Aloha @Stu,

I am using Apache/Passenger with Redmine on OS X 10.5. I am trying to use the
repository option in Redmine to display a Git repo. Unfortunately, I can’t seem
to get Apache, Redmine, and Git to play together. I am able to make it work
fine when using Webrick, but not Apache/Passenger. I have tried changing
permissions on the .git folder to _www, updating the apache2 conf, etc. to no
avail.

Would you (or anyone else) have any advice on how to make it work, since you
have it running already?

Thanks!

DrMark

DAparo on June 26, 2008 10:56 AM

Hello DrMark

I have redmine, passenger, git (using gitosis) and apache working together. I
have to run a script to update the repos view, otherwise they play well. Are
you getting any error messages?

DrMark on June 28, 2008 12:48 PM

@DAparo,

Hi. Thanks for responding.

First, I enable the Repository within a project in Redmine and point it to the
path of the .git folder. I then save that and navigate to the “Repository” tab.
I see this message:

“The entry or revision was not found in the repository.”

I know that the path and everything is correct because the exact same settings
work when I start script/server instead of using Apache/Passenger. I suspect
that it is an Apache path issue or a file permissions issue. Do you have any
special apache settings for the .git folder? What permissions are on that file?

Thanks!

DrMark

Blut Werte on June 29, 2008 07:12 AM

Is it possible to enable only read acess to different repositories for each
one. Not the git-damon way, since it exposes the same set of repositories for
every one.

DAparo on July 03, 2008 09:00 AM

@DrMark

Sorry for the long delay in getting back to you.

I think it may be repository permissions too. This is what got me. You run
script/server w/a user that has a public cert in the gitosis repos, but the
apache/passenger user doesn’t. Simple solution… create a cert for your
passenger user. Add it to gitosis server and assign permissions in
gitosis.conf. I gave my apache user read permissions on the entire direstory
and all files / folders within. I didn’t do anything special with the any .git
configs. I did have to run “ruby script/runner “Repository.fetch_changesets” -e
production” first.

Hope this helps…

DAparo on July 03, 2008 09:05 AM

Almost forgot… run the script as your passenger user. And make sure all your
app files are readable by your passenger user as well.

Miroslav Bazitov on July 05, 2008 04:28 AM

Hi folks,

I’ve setup gitosis very easy and everything in woks very smooth.

Right now I’m writing a small bash script to automate the recurring work of
creating repositories.

But my question is how can I remove a repository from gitosis? Can I just
delete /home/git/repositories/REPOSITORY.git (and clean the ~/gitosis-admin/
gitosis.conf) or there is an other way to remove it?

Tnx in advance! Miro

Danno on July 08, 2008 03:40 PM

If you keep getting asked for your password when executing git-remote commands
like this:

$git remote show origin Password:

...then you may need to tweak your ~/.ssh/config file. This didn’t happen to me
originally (I’m using OSX by the way). But, when I generated a new key pair for
use only with git and placed the public key in the gitosis-admin/keydir
(removing the original one used when setting up gitosis) then pushed, I started
being asked for my password. Since gitosis updated the git/.ssh/authorized_keys
file on the server with the new public key, the old one was no longer listed
there.

The problem is that by default ssh-keygen names your generated keys id_dsa or
id_rsa. OpenSSH scans your ~/.ssh dir looking for either of these when
automagically passing your identity during connection negotiation. Since my
local OpenSSH only knew to pass my id_dsa identity and the server only knew of
my danlynn identity, the connection negotiation failed back to interactive
password authentication.

To fix this, I modified my ~/.ssh/config file and added the following lines:

IdentityFile ~/.ssh/danlynn IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_dsa

Now, when executing any of the git-remote commands, they simply work.

Also, if you are using OSX then I highly reccommend that you install
SSHKeychain (http://www.sshkeychain.org/) because “SSHKeychain acts as a
gateway between you and the agent, it can automatically add keys when you need
them.” It interacts with the OSX keychain and can store all your key
passphrases. Thus, you never have to enter any ssh key passphrases. It’s really
slick.

Hello, When I try to create a new repository all I get is: $ push origin $
ERROR:gitosis.serve.main:Repository read access denied I use the same user for
the admin repository and the one I try to create. Are there any logfiles that
tell my why gitosis thinks that reading is not allowed?

Regards, Jan

Pegolon on July 24, 2008 01:25 AM

Hi, to install gitosis on a Mac OS X Leopard Server I used the recent version
of Python 2.5.2 of MacPorts and the hashlib: > port install python25
py25-hashlib which will be installed into /opt/local/bin, so make sure it is
included PATH before /usr/bin where the original version is.

To install the setup tools: > cd /usr/src > wget http://peak.telecommunity.com/
dist/ez_setup.py > python ez_setup.py

Source: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#
installation-instructions

Then “python /usr/src/setup.py install” will work as described above.

Cheers, Markus

Ryan on July 24, 2008 11:07 AM

Once I had everything installed, I ran:

% git clone git@MY_HOST:gitosis-admin.git

and I got:

Traceback (most recent call last): File ”/usr/bin/gitosis-serve”, line 7, in ?

It turned out that this was because I had rolled my own git and installed it at
/opt/git/bin. While this was in my path (and even in /etc/profile), it was not
in the path of the git user. I edited ~git/.bashrc, adding PATH=”/opt/git/
bin:$PATH”, and it started working.

Ryan on July 24, 2008 11:09 AM

Also, I wanted to point out that, in order to figure this out, it helped to
have this in my ~git/.gitosis.conf:

Daniel Barreto on July 25, 2008 03:35 PM

Hello everyone!

first i have to say this was a great tutorial! thank you very much.

second, I came to the comments looking for the answer to the
“ERROR:gitosis.serve.main:Repository read access denied” question. I didn’t
find what I was expecting but reading the opinion of some of you I solved my
problem. When i got the problem, i was using a dsa public key, the only thing I
did was change it to rsa and it worked =)..

finally it is working perfectly, but I got one question with git-daemon and I
want to try some luck here.

I get this error: “fatal: unable to allocate any listen sockets on host (null)
port 9418” when running git-daemon—base-path=/some/path I don’t understand why
it tells me null where my host should go =s. anyway, I tried:
git-daemon—base-path=/some/path—listen=MY_HOST_NAME and didn’t work either…

anyone knows something that could help me?

Michael G. Noll on August 01, 2008 06:08 AM

Thanks for this tutorial, garry!

Since you haven’t mentioned it in this tutorial (I also haven’t found it in the
gitosis documentation), you might want to add that a user can also have
multiple SSH keys for authentication, e.g. one public key from work and one
public key from home.

Just add the respective public keys to “keydir/<user>.pub”, i.e. one key per
line in the file. For instance, if user “jsmith” uses three different SSH keys
to connect via gitosis to a shared git repository, he would have three keys (=
three lines) in “keydir/jsmith.pub”.

Hope this helps, Michael

Mariya on August 04, 2008 04:06 PM

Just wanted to say thanks from a GitNoob. Good Git docs are still hard to come
by. Keep up the great work!

Garrett on August 05, 2008 04:06 PM

Something in the version that have required that the project description be
changed for the update scripts to work—you can see the various validation in
that script. Once I modified it by editing .git/description on both the remote
and local repositories, the remote push went through.

Graham Perks on August 05, 2008 08:33 PM

If you this this error when you go to access the remote repository:

bash: gitosis-serve: command not found

Then edit the remote “git” user’s .bashrc and include these lines to ensure /
usr/local/bin is in the path.

echo $PATH | grep -q -s ”/usr/local/bin” if [ $? -eq 1 ] ; then PATH=/usr/local
/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH export PATH fi

A prior poster’s comment about manually editing authorized_keys is a poor
workaround, since gitosis will rewrite that file when you add/remove users.

Graham Perks on August 05, 2008 08:35 PM

That little bit of .bashrc goodness should be:

echo $PATH | grep -q -s ”/usr/local/bin”

if [ $? -eq 1 ] ; then

PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH

export PATH

fi

Scott Motte on August 15, 2008 09:25 AM

To specify a custom port, you can also write something like this instead of
editing the /.ssh/config file:

git clone ssh://git@209.1.1.xxx:32767/home/git/repositories/gitosis-admin.git

Seeing the same error as Noah – OSError on load_entry_point(‘gitosis==0.2’,
‘console_scripts’, ‘gitosis-serve’)().

The setup.py and gitosis-init steps ran without error.

drwestco on August 20, 2008 09:19 AM

Oops – the call stack runs from top to bottom. ‘git-shell’ is missing from the
system.

drwestco on August 20, 2008 09:37 AM

Found a solution. Per the discussion at http://www.spinics.net/lists/git/
msg71059.html, I added the following to .bashrc for my git user:

export PATH=$(git—exec-path):$PATH

leword on August 20, 2008 02:50 PM

git clone git@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME:gitosis-admin.git

kept failing for me—asking for password. then I remembered that I had an
explicit list of user in sshd_config and hadn’t added git. (this is default
setup using articles from slicehost for example)

cgardner on August 20, 2008 05:07 PM

@Scott It took me about half an hour to figure that out. I guess that will
teach me to go through the comments first.

lenards on August 23, 2008 05:30 PM

If you’re getting ERROR:gitosis.serve.main:Repository read access denied

you’ll want to verify that you’re keys are correct – check the local versus the
.pub file in ~/repositories/gitosis-admin/gitosis-export/

then – make sure that you follow the tutorial… I was getting this message when
I had not added my repo to the gitosis.conf prior to pushing up the repo… so
make sure that you have the group and such in your gitosis.conf prior to doing
your `git push origin master`

I spent a ton of time searching about getting this going …

if you’re getting the os.py error – check and see if `git-shell` is in the
install directory… /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin … I needed to do a symlink to
`git-shell` from my install directory… I have git in /opt/git-1.6.0 with a
symlink to that as /opt/git … so as I update git – I just relink and that’ll
get the `git-shell` updated too.

Hope this saves some time for people

eflores on August 27, 2008 01:44 PM

silent(e): I had exactly the same problem with my keys not being accepted from
the windows client, I tried generating all types of new keys on my windows
machine but none worked. Finally what worked is for me to generate a new
keypair on my mac using

ssh-keygen -t dsa -f <keypairname>

I then copied the private key over to windows C:\Documents and Settings\
<username>\.ssh\id_dsa and did the same for the public key, calling it
id_dsa.pub

thanks garry for the well put together instructions, you saved me days of
frustration!

Rick Sandhu on August 30, 2008 05:06 PM

First of all, thank you for the generous tutorial. I was able to install
gitosis and clone, change and push gitosis-admin.git successfully to and from
local to server. The .gitosis.conf file even updated fine. However, when I
created the new project ‘test’ specified in gitosis.conf and tried to push it
to origin, i got the following error:

fatal: ‘repositories/test.git’: unable to chdir or not a git archive fatal: The
remote end hung up unexpectedly

Any thoughts?

Cynyr on September 04, 2008 10:10 AM

@Noah It looks like they have removed all of the symlinks and are expecting
people to switch to “git shell” or “git commit” instead of git-shell and
git-commit. Anyways I am using an older version of gitosis, so it may have
already been fixed.

kholzer on September 07, 2008 05:36 PM

Nice writeup. Thanks. Only thing I would add is that one may need to punch a
hole in one’s router (if one is behind NAT) at port 9418 for this all to work.

Thank you!

lobo_tuerto on September 08, 2008 01:35 PM

Hello, I recently update my Ubuntu server because of the recent problem with
generated SSH keys.

After updating the server, I had to re-generate the keys. Then I couldn’t do a
“git pull” anymore, I had to delete they old server’s key from ~/.ssh/
known_hosts. After deleting it, however I cannot pull. Gitosis is asking for a
password.

This might be because in my “client machine” the ssh keys were re-generated
too.

The question is: How do I update the key in the server? I want to put in the
server the key from the client machine that is controlling “gitosis”. Did that
make sense? :)

Help!

Michael on September 08, 2008 09:22 PM

There’s a really simple way to do this shown here: http://blog.commonthread.com
/2008/4/14/setting-up-a-git-server, it worked for us.

Garry on September 11, 2008 04:42 PM

@Cynyr, “git-shell” was changed to “git shell” in the latest gitosis.

Garry on September 11, 2008 04:48 PM

@lobo_tuerto, if you’ve followed the directions here, you’ll want to look at
this file:

/home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys

Put in your new public key in there, being careful to preserve the “command
=...” stuff.

Then update your gitosis-admin repo with your new pub key. Push this. You
should be allowed to push now b/c you changed authorized_keys. Gitosis will
overwrite authorized_keys at this point, but it is OK b/c you put your new pub
key into gitosis-admin repo.

That should do it. I’m typing this from memory, so hopefully I got it right. ;)

ryan on September 12, 2008 02:31 PM

Does anyone have any further clarification on making “multiple repositories”
work? I’d like to have the layout of my repositories directory organized into
sub-repositories, rather that just one giant directory filled with all the
’.git’ directories. I’d like to have somethings similar to:

/git/repositories/$USERNAME/$REPOSITORY, where I’d have several values for
$USERNAME like this:

/git/repositories/user1/project1.git /git/repositories/user1/project2.git /git/
repositories/user2/somthingelse.git /git/repositories/user3/myproject.git

etc. Basically have the same repository topography as github or the like. TIA.

djay on September 12, 2008 05:55 PM

Just a thought. it would be cool to have an “add” permission. That way the
admin doen’t need to explicitly add every project when its started.

Not sure how that works in practice but I think it means that gitosis will have
to append to the gitosis.conf file on the server. Then admin will later have to
do a pull and can further refine the permissions.

ed on September 18, 2008 01:54 PM

Great documentation Gary!

Thanks, ed

MikkelFJ on September 24, 2008 05:14 AM

This does not work on Debian Etch with ssh password login disabled. workaround:
add password to git user. reason: debian locks passwordless accounts insecure
workaround 2: UsePAM = yes in sshd_config – but you shouldn’t have PAM login
active.

Excellent article worked out of the box the first time I tried (except
installation see below).

But then I secured my system according to: http://articles.slicehost.com/2007/9
/5/debian-etch-setup-page-1

/etc/ssh/sshd_config: UsePAM = no

If UsePAM is set to yes, it will work even with password authentication
disabled, but it is not fully secure. With UsePAM set to no, it will only work
if a password is added to the git(osis) user account.

The reason is that Debian locks passwordless accounts, but somehow pam_unix
circumvents this over ssh hence it will work with UsePAM = yes.

Debian Etch install procedure:

$ apt-get install python-setuptools && apt-get install gitosis $ sudo passwd
gitosis $ <prompt password for>

Dependencies on python-setuptools does not work correctly (at least in my
version) so it must be installed first as the article also says. If gitosis is
attempted installed first, it must be removed before python tools is installed_

$ apt-get remove gitosis

If gitosis-init is called again with a new public key, the old key will remain
installed. Remove content of .ssh and repositories directories in the git user
account , then run gitosis-init again.

Debian installer creates user “gitosis” with home directory ”/srv/gitosis”
which is fine, but different from the above article. It is also possible to
manually create a “git” user according to the above. In both cases a password
must be added on secured systems.

Apparently the update hook has the correct permissions from install, so this
isn’t necessary to change.

gitosis is a very nice tool

Mikkel

Elektronik on October 01, 2008 11:26 PM

“And on gentoo, python setup tools are dev-python/setuptools” Thats true

ellie on October 11, 2008 06:58 PM

I agree, it did not work on Debian Etch!

Laran on October 11, 2008 11:29 PM

When executing this:

git clone git@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME:gitosis-admin.git cd gitosis-admin

I get prompted for the git users password. I didn’t setup a password though. I
followed the directions which used the—disabled-password flag.

Incidentally, I’m doing the whole setup process on the same machine, in case
it’s relevant.

FunnyMan on October 13, 2008 07:27 PM

The reason your custom port is failing is that git can’t figure out what you’re
trying to do. Use this form instead:

ssh://git@myserver.com:1234/foo/bar

Note the added protocol and the removed colon.

colinta on November 02, 2008 10:52 PM

i’m wondering if anyone has used gitosis on a linux (ubuntu) server to keep a
website application in sync, like one would do using rsync.

I’m thinking that just by issuing:

~/src/website $ git push mysite.com live

the live branch would be pushed to the gitosis server, and the files in /home/
git/repositories/website would be updated, which would also act as the document
root for the web server.

any thoughts? is this feasible?

Liutauras on November 06, 2008 04:19 AM

colinta I would recommend to have a look at Capistrano. In my case I’m pushing
to my remote git repository and while deploying capistrano is automaticaly
pulling it from there and deploy it as current release.

Peter on November 17, 2008 09:08 PM

Great article Garry…

I am having some trouble though, I hope you can help.

I have followed the instructions to the letter. The server is on Ubuntu 8.04
and the client (local) is Mac OS X 10.5.5.

When I issue this command on the local machine: “git clone
git@192.168.111.52:gitosis-admin.git”, the server returns this:

Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/&lt;username>/programming/git/gitosis-admin/.git/
git@192.168.111.52's password:

I suspect this has something to do with the SSH public key. I did create on on
the local machine, copied it to the server, and issued the command “sudo -H -u
git gitosis-init < /tmp/id_rsa.pub”. This command returned the two
“Initialized” lines as you show in your article.

I understand that git is a system user without password, which means that the
SSH key is the only way to authenticate. But apart from that, I can’t figure
out what I’m doing wrong.

Any help is much appreciated!

Garry on November 18, 2008 12:22 AM

@Peter you have to make sure the “git” user has your pub key in its authorized
keys file. If you followed these directions exactly, it should be there. Double
check.

Peter on November 18, 2008 04:24 PM

I repeated the steps a few time so I doubt I missed anything, although I am far
from perfect.

It finally worked when I created a normal user (I tried this in Fedora and
Ubuntu Linux) using the graphical interface. So the only step I “customised”
was the manual creation of the git user. I followed all further steps exactly
as you set them, and I was finally able to get the gitosis-admin file on my
local machine.

I am a newcomer to Linux so I suspect that not creating a system user may have
some security implications. I removed all common user privileges to the git
user I created, but still I would be very interested in your comments.

Thanks!

Garry on November 20, 2008 01:17 AM

Peter, if your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file has “UsePAM yes”, then PAM may have
denied you logging in as your “git” user because of various reasons. The most
common one I’ve seen is that the account is “locked”. What makes an account
locked is dependent on your PAM setup. Changing the password field for the
“git” user in /etc/shadow from ! to a * has been reported to solve the problem.

pillowfactory on November 25, 2008 11:56 AM

StefanScott on December 02, 2008 03:31 PM

I used PuttyGen on Windows to generate my public key (SSH2 RSA 1024) and save
it locally, and then I uploaded it to /tmp/id_rsa.pub using pscp, but then when
I ran

sudo -H -u git gitosis-init < /tmp/id_rsa.pub

I kept getting errors, eg:

gitosis.init.InsecureSSHKeyUsername: Username contains not allowed characters:
‘[DEL:—:DEL]‘

or:

gitosis.init.InsecureSSHKeyUsername: Username contains not allowed
characters:’”rsa-key-20081202”’

or (after I got rid of everything in the file but the key itself):

ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack

I figured that PuttyGen had generated an SSH2 public key file in a slightly
different format, and ‘git gitosis-init’ wanted a user name at the beginning,
so I went here:

http://www.rfc-archive.org/getrfc.php?rfc=4716

and saw that I could keep the “[DEL:—BEGIN…” and “:DEL]—END” parts, and replace
the “comment: ...” line (generated by PuttyGen) with a line reading:

subject: git

And it worked! I got the output:

Initialized empty Git repository in /home/git/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/
Reinitialized existing Git repository in /home/git/repositories/
gitosis-admin.git/

I had the same problem – it was because my machine had a firewall blocking
outgoing connections on port 9418, the port that git uses.

Different machines will have different firewalls set up. In my case (on Debian
Etch), I first tried to change iptables – but there was nothing to do there, as
it was already allowing all outgoing connections.

Turns out my VPS (virtual private server) hosting provider had an external
firewall blocking most outgoing connections, and I had to open up port 9418
there, via their web interface.

framallo on December 09, 2008 04:05 AM

nice post! I’m just wondering how to integrate it with git-svn. The
repositories folder doesn’t have a git repo like the one i have in the desktop.
I think it’s only the .git folder (with objects,refs folders and config file)
right? anyway the basic workflow to git-svn for an existing repository is Don’t
run git svn init bc you’ll create a new repo, just add this to your .git/config
file: [svn-remote “svn”] url = https://svn.richapplabs.com/tech/modcart-dev/
trunk/ModCloth fetch = :refs/remotes/git-svn then run git fetch if you want to
have only part of the history run: git fecth -r <revision_number>

you could check with git svn info

instead of svn update you’ll run: git svn rebase

Instead of svn commit you’ll run git svn dcommit

however i don’t know how to add this to a gitosis server to share a git-svn
repo

Emily on December 09, 2008 11:59 PM

Wouter on December 10, 2008 08:50 AM

Can anybody explain me the internals of gitosis? Or point me to some
documentation? I was reading to the gitosis code but it didn’t make much sense
to me. Probably because git itself is also pretty new to me…

Tzury Bar Yochay on December 14, 2008 07:07 AM

As far as I managed to gather from the README file here is the magic: the linux
user (ssh/login) is a single user which created without password. This user is
shared amongst al the repositories you are hosting.

Since all keys at ~/.ssh/authorized_keys are defined with command=
’gitosis-serve’ option, all the commands are to be enforced to go via
gitosis-serve which apply a filter on the commands supplied and act
accordingly.

you can read more about this command option at: http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/

reglogge on December 17, 2008 08:16 AM

Hi and thanks from also for this excellent guide. I would like to contribute
something back by showing a solution to a problem I encountered.

My problem was that I had a cloned repository of one of my projects running on
the same server as gitosis and had cloned it by using the direct path to the
gitosis-repo (e.g. /home/git/repositories/my_project.git).

Whenever I pushed some changes from the cloned repository back to the
gitosis-repo, the ownership for the new objects in /home/git/repositories/
my_project.git/objects got set to the owner I ran the push command with (in my
case root). The result was that pulls and pushes from other cloned repositories
(on other developers’ machines) aborted with errors since they couldn’t write
or read from and to the gitosis-repo.

The solution lay in switching the directive in .git/config from

[remote “origin”] url = /home/git/repositories/my_project.git

to: [remote “origin”] url = git@gitosis-server:my_project.git

and adding the public key for root to gitosis-admin/keydir as well as adding
root to the authorized users of the project in gitosis-admin/gitosis.conf and
then pushing those changes to the server.

No more wrong ownerships in /home/git/repositories/my_project.git/objects.

ERROR:gitosis.serve.main:Repository read access denied fatal: The remote end
hung up unexpectedly

I got this because the key name specified in the gitosis.conf file was not the
same as the name of the key file in the keydir folder. I was copying and
pasting from one admin to another – oops.

marv on January 18, 2009 01:10 AM

Haha, just wanted to say that you really nailed it with the “I’m repeating
myself for those who skim” part after the first headline. I came to the page
through google, saw a bunch of yada yada introductory stuff and skipped to the
first headline. And got exactly the answer I was looking for. :)

Jason F on January 19, 2009 10:49 PM

Excellent post Garry- thanks for all the great work on gitosis.

N3uro5i5 on January 25, 2009 02:49 AM

Adduser doesn’t work for me. Alternatively i’ve use “sudo useradd git -d /home/
git -c ‘git version control’ -s /bin/sh -g git -r -m” on my ArchLinux distro.

For users who find “unable to chdir or not a git archive” error

git clone git@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME:/REPOSITORIES_PATH/gitosis-admin.git

note that is the same syntax than a secure copy (scp).

Koppenhoefer on January 29, 2009 03:50 AM

Has anyone got SSHKeychain working as described by Danno on July 08 (See
above)??

When I’m in a project folder on the mac (and yes SSHKeychain is running) and I
do a ‘git pull’ I am required to enter the ssh passphrase. I expected to not
have to enter it next time… but no such luck.. I have to enter it each and
every time.

Anyone had success with this? Can you enlighten me ? Thanks. Shawn

Garry on February 04, 2009 01:11 AM

@marv See! I knew people wouldn’t read the intro ;)

Shoaibi on February 05, 2009 11:11 PM

Thanks… such a great tutorial…

Richie on February 06, 2009 11:39 AM

if you are at an end figuring out why you are getting the following error even
after making sure the keys are in sync like advised in previous posts:
ERROR:gitosis.serve.main:Repository read access denied fatal: The remote end
hung up unexpectedly

make sure (server side) <git home>/.gitosis.conf is a symlink to <git home>/
repositories/gitosis-admin.git/gitosis.conf

essentially, gitosis-serve refers to <git home>/.gitosis.conf file but the real
config file (that gets updated when you push) is in the gitosis-admin repo (as
per above).

I had moved the repos over to a new server and inadvertently caused <git home>
/.gitosis.conf to become a copy of the real file an not a symlink thus causing
an out of sync issue. All old repos were working for months but recently I’d
added new repos to the config and just couldn’t get it to work till now :)

MySchizoBuddy on February 06, 2009 11:41 PM

There is lot manual editing of config files. How would you add/users/repo/
permissions via an automated system or via a web browser.

Andrew Uselton on February 07, 2009 02:24 PM

I found that the setuptools RPM did not install correctly. The manual steps
that follow worked. This is essentially what “sudo rpm -ivh …” should have
done:

cd ~/src rpm2cpio ~/download/setuptools-0.6c9-1.src.rpm | cpio -ivd tar xvfz
setuptools-0.6c9.tar.gz cd setuptools-0.6c9 sudo python setup.py install

Andrew Uselton on February 07, 2009 03:47 PM

follow-up. It looks like gitosis requires a minimum of Python 2.5. I was able
to manually work around the “subprocess” requirement (2.4), but I’m not sure I
can do the same with the string.rsplit method (introduced in 2.5). Since I’m on
a system that has a lot of other software I’m leary of just upgrading Python (I
have 2.3) on speculation.

Andrew Barringer on February 09, 2009 01:51 PM

On Ubuntu 8.0.4.. if you use user name of “git” it doesn’t work. You will end
up with this error.

fatal: ‘gitosis-admin.git’: unable to chdir or not a git archive fatal: The
remote end hung up unexpectedly

if you look at the authorized_key file you will see that it did not import the
name of the system that key was generated on but the name of the server box.

Example: using a username of “git” resulted in this in the authorized key

root@git-repo:/home/git/.ssh# cat authorized_keys command=”gitosis-serve
root@git-repo”

After changing to user name “gitosis” it looks like this root@git-repo:/home/
gitosis/.ssh# cat authorized_keys command=”gitosis-serve myuser@mylocalbox”,
etc etc….

To fix I created a user gitosis with home dir of /home/gitosis and ran the
git-init script again.

sudo -H -u gitosis gitosis-init < /tmp/id_rsa.pub

sudo chmod 755 /home/gitosis/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/hooks/post-update

on local box.. git clone gitosis@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME:gitosis-admin.git

jayr on February 10, 2009 02:24 PM

Great tutorial.

I followed all of the instructions and am able to create repositories and add
users from my local clone of gitosis-admin.

I am also able to cd to a clean area in my /home directory and create a clone
of the free_monkey repository I created and pushed to the server from under the
gitosis-admin structure.

What I cannot do is clone the new repository from any other user that I have
added to the gitosis.conf file. I have checked that the public keys for the
added users are exactly the same on the local machine and in the /home/git/
repositories/gitosis-admin.git/gitosis-export/keydir directory on the server.
The added users have not been added to the /home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys file
(only my admin account is present in this file).

The error that I am getting is:

prompt>:[/gitplayground> git clone git@SERVER_NAME:free_monkey.git Initialized
empty Git repository in /home/buildman/gitplayground/free_monkey/.git/
Password: Password: Password: Permission denied
(publickey,gssapi-with-mic,keyboard-interactive). fatal: The remote end hung up

The tail of the /var/log/messages file is:

Again, I can clone, modify files, commit and push using the admin account:

We are running with Kerberos on openSUSE 10.2

Any help will be appreciated.

One thing that wasn’t obvious to me is that (or how) a group can be writable on
many projects, like:

[group foobar] writable = baaz quux members = fancis jepherson hoover

etc. Makes for a smaller config file when many members are working on the same
few projects.

I linked you for the guide in my “notes” blog, it is in italian ..thanks !

Josh on February 19, 2009 04:51 PM

If you want to explore the git user directory, type

sudo -i

I had issue with access denied messages, try recreating the user account.

Paul C. on February 20, 2009 05:23 AM

When you run gitosis-init for a user, it locks out regular ssh shell access:

debug1: Entering interactive session. PTY allocation request failed on channel
0 ERROR:gitosis.serve.main:Need SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND in environment. debug1:
client_input_channel_req: channel 0 rtype exit-status reply 0

This lock out is in serve.py around like 183. Is there a way to turn this off
without hacking this script??

If not, is there a way of uninstalling/uniniting gitosis for a user that
gitosis-init has been run for? I can’t figure out how it hooks into ssh.

I want ssh shell access for my git user.

Thanks.

Paul C. on February 20, 2009 07:55 PM

nevermind – I found the hook – it is in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.

I just needed to simply blow that file out to get rid of gitosis on that user.

Nico Kadel-Garcia on February 24, 2009 02:13 PM

Creating new repositories is a bit confusing, because you must create and
commit something in order to do the first push successfully.

It’s pretty easy to simply upload an existing repository, as follows. Add your
new repository name such as ‘newrepo.git’ to the gitosis-admin.git setups, with
SSH keys as needed, and then run this.

git status # to make sure you're where you want to be
git remote add gitosis git@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME:newrepo.git
git diff git@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME:newrepo.git/master # to make sure you're not stepping on existing work
git push gitosis master:refs/heads/master

jmeridth on February 26, 2009 09:26 PM

1. I followed all the instructions 2. It worked great 3. Added new user. Had
bad pub key. started everything over again. 4. I am able to work with
gitosis-admin repo just fine 5. I have 2 other groups, one with the same user I
use for gitosis-admin, and another of the newer user 6. group 2 has 8 repos

[group userone] members = userone@hostone writable = one two three four five
six seven eight

7. userone is able to git init locally and “git push origin master:refs/heads/
master” to 5 of the 8 repos. 8. the three repos (two, six, eight) get the
following error when running push command from above: fatal: unable to connect
a socket (Connection refused)

errno=Connection refused
errno=Connection refused

9. other group and user:

[group usertwo] members = usertwo@hosttwo writable = one_repo

10. This user gets the same error from #8 when pushing to his repo

I’m at a loss. I’ve triple checked the id_rsa.pub files from each user. I’ve
started from scratch a few times. I even created new local folders, git init,
git remote add…, and get the error when I try to “git push origin master:refs/
heads/master”

ANY help is greatly appreciated

reglogge on March 01, 2009 02:59 AM

I’m having a problem with accessing the gitosis-hosted repos from a new machine
and hope maybe somebody here has an idea:

- My gitosis-server is running git version 1.6.0.4 on a Debian Etch distro -
Another machine which has no problems accessing the gitosis-server (via ssh)
runs git version 1.6.0.5 on Mac OS/X 10.5.6 - The new machine which should also
be able to access the gitosis-server via ssh rund git version 1.5.6.4 on a
Gentoo Linux distro. But this machine cannot access the gitosis-server via ssh.
Wenever I try to ‘git pull’ or ‘git push’ from that machine I get the error
message ‘Permission denied, please try again.’

Cloning the remote repository from the gitosis-server to the git 1.5.6.4
machine works via the git-protocol but then I have no way to push back changes.
I followed all the steps in adding a new user to gitosis just like on the other
remote machine running git 1.6.0.5 but to no avail.

So my questions: - Can it be that gitosis has a problem with remote machines
running different versions of git? - Or can anybody see another problem i must
have overlooked?

Thanks in advance

HokieTux on March 03, 2009 10:23 AM

Hey! I just wanted to say thanks for the awesome blog post! It helped me a lot
when I was going through the Gitosis set-up process.

I just wrote a guide on getting Git, Gitosis, and Gitweb all set-up and
running, and linked to you for the Gitosis section: http://hokietux.net/blog/?p
=58 ; just a heads-up =)

Thanks again!

Al on March 03, 2009 07:42 PM

In the section below you say to generate a public key – do you mean for the GIT
user? or for your own regular named user like ‘myusername’.

Following your instructions I still get an error when i try to push with: git
push origin master:refs/heads/master

What i get is: error: src refspec master does not match any. fatal: The remote
end hung up unexpectedly error: failed to push some refs to
‘git@myservername:myreponame.git’

Any suggestions would be of great help.

==============================

You will need a public SSH key to continue. If you don’t have one, you may
generate one on your local computer:

ssh-keygen -t rsa

The public key will be in $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. Copy this file to your server
(the one running gitosis).

Next we will run a command that will sprinkle some magic into the home
directory of the git user and put your public SSH key into the list of
authorized keys.

sudo -H -u git gitosis-init < /tmp/id_rsa.pub

id_rsa.pub above is your public SSH key that you copied to the server. I
recommend you put it in /tmp so the git user won’t have permission problems
when trying to read it. Success looks like:

jpablobr on March 04, 2009 08:31 PM

I’m having the exact same problem… error: src refspec master does not match
any. fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly Also, I did the: sudo -H -u git
gitosis-init < /tmp/id_rsa.pub And I have the exact same key from my local
computer in my server’s /tmp/ directory…. Not sure if I should edit something
in my /etc/ssh/sshd_config?? Could someone please help me…. thanks!

tsyd on March 07, 2009 06:00 PM

@Al @jpablobr I had the same problem, and I believe it occurred because I was
trying to commit an empty repo. In any case, running:

$ git commit—allow-empty

in my empty repo solved it.

wallu on March 15, 2009 12:28 PM

How can I clone local repository, e.g. “git-clone git@localhost:myapp.git”?

Arlen Cuss on March 25, 2009 02:59 PM

As it turns out, it’s important that a valid running shell is suggested.

I tried using /bin/false to prevent log-in (though it turns out ~git/.ssh/
authorized_keys does more than a good enough job of this), and it resulted in
me getting no debug messages, nothin’! Just “The remote end hung up
unexpectedly”.

So go ahead and use /bin/sh, they can’t use it anyway.

James Strachan on March 27, 2009 02:03 AM

mtkd: massive thanks! I hit exactly the same problem and was tearing my hair
out trying to figure out why the first clone was faliing.

garry: great article! its maybe worth updating the instructions to mention
mtkd’s issue & resolution; am sure others will hit this, needing to fix
AlloowUsers etc.

I found this page helped: https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/serverguide/C/
user-management.html

I just hacked /etc/ssh/sshd_config and added ‘git’ to AllowUsers and it then
worked like a charm.

David Valentiate on March 28, 2009 08:13 PM
On a fresh install I was getting an error when trying to ‘git push’ the
gitosis.conf changes:

  • Project description file hasn’t been set error: hooks/update exited with
    error code 1

I edited: /home/git/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/description replacing the
contents with ‘gitosis’

things seems to be back on track

hims on March 29, 2009 01:57 AM

awesome, great job. thanks so much :-)

netricate on April 01, 2009 08:48 AM

great tutorial…

the one hiccup i had was when i added another computer’s key, i must have done
something out of order. It complained that “Repository read access denied” for
my new user. I checked the config file and everything seemed to check out.

To solve I reissued: git push origin master:refs/heads/master

it solved my access issue. Hope that helps someone.

Balint Erdi on April 02, 2009 12:12 AM

wallu, to clone from a repo on localhost, you have to provide a /path/to/repo
as the git clone URL, see http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/
git-clone.html

For example: git clone /home/git/repositories/free_monkey.git/

Also, make sure that does the cloning (and possible subsequent git operations)
has read rights to the repoistory directory. I achieved that with adding the
user to the git group.

Hope that helps, Balint

Karl Kornel on April 02, 2009 12:15 PM

OK, here’s a weird problem. When trying to do the initial push of a new
repository, I’m getting the repository read access denied message. My SSH key
is OK, and the .gitosis.conf symlink is OK. What I noticed, though, is that the
gitosis.conf on the server is out-of-date; it doesn’t have the change I pushed
creating the new test repository.

Just to be sure, I went back to my gitosis-admin working copy: `git commit -a`
tells me my working directory is clean, and `git push` tells me everything is
up-to-date. I even deleted and re-created my working copy; the gitosis.conf in
my working copy is current, but the gitosis.conf on the server is not.

dajoe13 on April 03, 2009 10:52 PM

I ran into the problem discussed last august with the error:

bash: gitosis-serve: command not found

when I try to git clone.

I tried the modification suggested to the .bashrc file. This does not solve the
problem. It seems that the .bashrc file does not get run when we git from the
server or ssh from the server. At least this is the case at the point the
gitosis-serve command is forced in the authorized_keys file.

Any help would eb greatly appreciated.

dajoe13 on April 04, 2009 09:14 AM

re: bash: gitosis-serve: command not found

I solved this problem. The path set by sshd before running the command in the
authorized_key file is /usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin, at least on my SUSE 11.1
system. I believe this is based on PATH set on ssh at compile time. The .bashrc
file in the ~git dir cannot not influence PATH before sshd runs the command in
the authorized_keys file.

A solution is to set PATH in ~git/.ssh/environment <<< PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/
usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin, <<<

(If there is a more portable way to do this? I would appreciate someone
pointing it out. I tried PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH and it did
not work.)

and set “PermitUserEnvironment yes” in /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Elvis on April 07, 2009 01:42 AM

Garry, I follow the steps for times, but I always stuck in this step

git clone git@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME:gitosis-admin.git

It always show me this message

Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/<username>/programming/git/
gitosis-admin/.git/ git@192.168.111.52’s password:

You said I have to generate a public key belongs to ‘git’, should i generate on
my local machine? or the gitosis one??

If I should generate public key on local machine, should I create a user ‘git’
and then execute ssh-keygen??

Elvis on April 07, 2009 05:20 AM

Garry, My environment is on Ubuntu intrepid

You mentioned this “you have to make sure the “git” user has your pub key in
its authorized keys file” on previous comment. But I found my public key file
used “myusername@myservername” instead of “git”@myservername.

I’ve followed the tutorial and created a user named git for gitosis. And then I
execute ssh-keygen -t rsa on my gitosis server and then put it to /tmp on my
gitosis server.

Then I ran sudo -H -u git gitosis-init < /tmp/id_rsa.pub and it passed.

Then I change mode 755 for post-update and it passed as well.

But it always asking for password when I ran
“git@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME:gitosis-admin.git”

Check the id_rsa.pub file, it does not generate the “git@myservername” for user
git. Did this issue caused that I cannot pass
“git@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME:gitosis-admin.git”??

If it is, can u please tell me where i miss??

Robert on April 09, 2009 06:48 AM

Hi.

First thanks for this wonderfull tutorial.

Second to the people suffering from the password problem. I too was suffering
from this until I remembered I disabled RSA and Public Key authenticathion on
my server’s SSHd configuration. Once I re-enabled them, git clone worked
flawlessly.

- Robert Grunauer

Garry on April 11, 2009 02:53 AM

@Elvis, look in your /var/log/auth.log to see what SSH is doing. Will give you
a clue as to why it is asking for a password.

Cesar on April 13, 2009 09:56 AM

Regarding non-standard SSH ports. You might consider rewriting the url as
follows: [DEL:-:DEL]: git@myserver.com:1234:/foo/bar [INS:+:INS]: ssh://
git@myserver.com:1234/foo/bar

and everything works like a charm without any need of changing ~/.ssh/config

markatharvest on April 13, 2009 12:56 PM

Thanks a ton.. I got the git configured with gitosis and gitweb. I breezed
through gitosis very fast than I had imagined..

Elvis on April 14, 2009 10:47 PM

@Garry, thanks, I ‘ve found what’s going on with my git. I corrected the folder
attribute both on client and server. It works fine finally.

Mark Nelson on April 16, 2009 08:09 AM

Hello Garry

I have followed the instructions in the blog and I have successfully completed
the initial set up of gitosis and I am able to push the gitosis config back to
the git server. However, when I try to create the test repository I get the
message -

ERROR:gitosis.serve.main:Repository read access denied fatal: The remote end
hung up unexpectedly

when trying to execute the following command –

git push origin master:refs/heads/master

I have tried to re-installing gitosis a couple of times but I am getting the
same error.

Any ideas

Mark.

punkrats on April 21, 2009 10:13 AM

Hi everyone, I host several repositories with gitosis and had this error:

ERROR:gitosis.serve.main:Repository read access denied fatal: The remote end
hung up unexpectedly

Solved it by assigning different groups in gitosis-admin/gitosis.conf, e.g.

[group firstproject] writable = firstproject members = punkrats@Webware-Lab

[group secondproject] writable = secondproject members = punkrats@Webware-Lab

After commit and push origin master, everything worked as expected. Cheers.

Elvis on April 22, 2009 02:18 AM

@Mark

I think it might be the permission problem, you can check the owner of your
test repo. It should not belong to root.

Nolan on April 23, 2009 12:21 PM

I really appreciate this article. It got me through about 95%, and had to tweak
the rest myself. But couldn’t have done it without it. Thanks!

I after trying for hours to solve this, I found that by doing is in two steps,

 1. sudo -H -u git -s

Step 2: $ gitosis-init < /tmp/id_rsa.pub Initialized empty Git repository in /
home/git/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/ Reinitialized existing Git repository
in /home/git/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/

That’s it.

What is the difference between using

git push

and

git push origin master:refs/heads/master

gnijholt on May 20, 2009 12:35 AM

I have everything working except for one thing. I clone the repositories
(containing websites) locally using ”$ cd /a/www.website1.com/” ”$ git clone /
home/git/repositories/website1.git htdocs” but this fails because the /home/git
files are obviously owned by user ‘git’, whereas the files in /a/* are all
owned by myself. If I use sudo to do the clone operation, it goes works but the
files in the cloned repo are owned by root. What is the best solution to this
problem? (and ofcourse I prefer not to have to execute chown -R myself:myself)

Thanks in advance!

bobby on June 13, 2009 08:25 AM

so close:

when running the command:

I get the following error message:

Sorry, user bsmith is not allowed to execute ’/usr/bin/gitosis-init’ as git on

I am very, very happy to learn more about python, git and bash of course in
this post.

I work with linux since SUS 5.2 but this is very usefull stuff. Thx a lot!

gjhames on June 15, 2009 02:26 PM

when I ran the command: git clone git@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME:gitosis-admin.git

didn’t work. I had to put the entire directory of the gitosis-admin.git, like

git clone git@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME:~/repositories/gitosis-admin.git

other big problem that I’m having: I cannot create a new repository. when I run
this command:

git push origin master:refs/heads/master

after doing all the others, I receive this message fatal: ‘free_monkey.git’:
unable to chdir or not a git archive fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly

And, I can see in my server, in the /home/git/repositories directory, that
there is not created a directory called ‘free_monkey.git’

gittin it on June 17, 2009 08:50 AM

When I installed gitosis (Ubuntu 9.04), it created a ‘gitosis’ user (with ’*’
for password entry in /etc/shadow). Should I be using this user, instead of
creating and using a ‘git’ user as in the instructions?

gittin it on June 17, 2009 08:56 AM

Never mind … ignore previous question. It’s answered in the gitosis readme (/
usr/share/doc/gitosis/README.Debian), and it’s clear that the ‘gitosis’ user is
meant to be the repository owner. Instructions should be updated to reflect
this.

gittin it on June 17, 2009 09:02 AM

I should point out that the gitosis install was done via apt-get. The package
apparently creates the ‘gitosis’ user, since the README.rst file (http://
eagain.net/gitweb/?p=gitosis.git;a=blob;f=README.rst;hb=master) talks about
doing it by hand if you install via source.

SXLee on June 20, 2009 09:05 PM

Hi,Garry,Thank you for your great turtal,i helps me a lot.

But I got a problem about asking password when i execute the command:git clone
git@SERVER:gitosis-admin.git So I check the auth.log file for some detail , and
it shows : sshd^27229: Failed password for git from IP port 34647 ssh2 But the
git user should have no password . I try to set a password for git , and it
works .

I have checked all the comments for an answer , but found nothing .

Do you have any idears about this ?? Thanks!!

snackycracky on June 26, 2009 02:04 AM

the workaround for new repositories and the error fatal: ‘free_monkey.git’:
unable to chdir or not a git archive fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
is to:

mkdir ~/repositories/free_monkey.git cd ~/repositories/free_monkey.git && git
init—bare

snackycracky on June 26, 2009 02:10 AM

and for the ones who cant connect to the server edit ~/.ssh/authorized_keys and
remove with the comma at the end: command=”gitosis-server user@localhost”, this
is no good solution but it helps when i tried to enter some other command like
git clone or something i get the usage syntax of gitosis-server [OPT] USER or
something, but the man page for gitosis server is really not giving any
information…

boscomonkey on June 29, 2009 02:44 PM

These instructions worked fine on Ubuntu 9.0.4 with one minor bug: “python
setup.py install” requires a sudo since it’s creating files in /usr/local/bin
(among other places).

The correct command should be: “sudo python setup.py install” (without quotes).

benw on July 13, 2009 06:11 AM

Thanks for this. How about tagging a release so I can tell the boss what
version of gitoisis I installed? It’s been a year since the last commit and two
years since release/0.2.

sneaker39 on July 15, 2009 09:58 AM

I found an excellent howto at http://sunoano.name/ws/public_xhtml/scm.html#
provide_a_git_repository_to_the_public

sneaker39 on July 16, 2009 05:15 AM

as grempe wrote above already—see “grempe on November 19, 2007 02:37 PM”

I set things up as told here http://sunoano.name/ws/public_xhtml/scm.html#
provide_a_git_repository_to_the_public

then I also wanted to use “daemon = yes” so the file git-daemon-export-ok get’s
autogenerated by gitosis and git-daemon knows it can serve this paritcular repo
to anonymous users.

Bottom Line:

Setting daemon = yes in the [group foo] stanza in .gitosis.conf does not
autogenerate ../foo.git/git-daemon-export-ok and thus foo.git cannot be served
in read-only mode to anonymous users.

How do we solve this issue resp. make it work as expected? Maybe some of us do
something wrong? I am using the debian gitosis package.

grow taller 4 idiots on July 21, 2009 01:02 PM

It’s answered in the gitosis readme

sneaker39 on July 21, 2009 10:22 PM

@grow_taller …

no, it’s not. If you’re refering to the “Using git-daemon” section of the
readme you’ll see it mentions what I said above already but doing so does not
trigger the autogeneration of the file git-daemon-export-ok.

Suno Ano on July 24, 2009 06:39 AM

Hi folks,

about the issue with git-daemon-export-ok being automatically created … you
have to use a [repo foo] stanza and not a [group foo] stanza; see here http://
sunoano.name/ws/public_xhtml/scm.html#providing_a_repository_to_the_world for
more info

Tim on July 25, 2009 09:33 PM

To those of you having the “read access denied” error when trying to do your
initial push to the repository: Make sure you ran the ‘chmod’ command in the
tutorial. That was the only thing I skipped, and was having the mentioned
problem. It appears that the config file doesn’t get updated with your new
repository settings if you skip that step.

merzedes on August 04, 2009 02:17 AM

Hi Garry. Have you considered adding os.environ[‘GITOSIS_USER’]=user at ~line
202 in serve.py as suggested in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/824990/
git-gitosis-how-to-check-validity-of-user-name-and-email ? This would allow to
use the pushing user in pre-/post-receive scripts for commit policies or just
notification. It seems quite handy.

Strange thing – on git push gitosis does not adds key for new user to the /home
/git/.ssh/authorized_keys. What can i do?

luxigo on August 26, 2009 05:48 AM

hello,

the beginning of the tutorial is ok, until:

“git push origin master:refs/heads/master”

ERROR:gitosis.serve.main:Repository read access denied fatal: The remote end
hung up unexpectedly

(i added a file with “git add” and commited with “git commit” before)

what did change since 2007 ?...

please update this how-to :)

luxigo on August 26, 2009 07:17 AM

Please move the “sudo chmod 755 /home/git/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/hooks/
post-update”

after “git clone git@YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME:gitosis-admin.git”

Thanks !

Theo on August 31, 2009 09:22 PM

Just a note to others about permissions on the authorized_keys file; I had to
make the following permission changes before gitosis would update this file:

chmod 755 /home/git chmod 700 /home/git/.ssh chmod 644 /home/git/.ssh/
authorized_keys

Prior to these changes git kept asking for a password for users who I had added
to the keydir but were not been persisted to authorized_keys. Obviously there
are security implications to these changes.

Tonop on September 06, 2009 03:11 AM

Hi Garry, Thanks a lot for awesome tutorial.

for freesbd to add package python-setup tools you need to run: cd /usr/ports/
devel/py-setuptools && make && make install clear

tomster on September 06, 2009 11:02 AM

I found a bit simpler way to install gitosis without ‘polluting’ the
system-wide python. To get it working with virtualenv all is necessary is to
replace the two calls in the post-update hook with absolute paths. No mucking
about with $PYTHONPATH (evil!!) or /etc/environment.

You can find a more detailed write-up over at my blog, if you need: http://

io on September 11, 2009 12:56 PM

Thanks for the tutorial! So it uses ssh key to authenticate. But doesn’t
actually connect though a ssh tunnel, right? Is there a way to enable that?

Manu on September 22, 2009 05:50 AM

Hi,

thanks for the great post.

As far as I can see, the gitosis operations on the server will run as “git”
(with the user “git”). Is there a way to prevent users (who push code) from
doing anything beyond pushing code ?

If I am right (and I am probably not), the git user is just open to anybody (no
password), and has a shell, so anybody can login the box as “git” and do
whatever he wants.

Where am I wrong ?

Manu on September 22, 2009 07:17 AM

just wanted to withdraw my comment. I looked at cactus’s Q more that 2 years
ago and it is the same as mine. Seems that I need to make some homework on ssh
setup though…

angriukas on October 01, 2009 07:37 AM

thanks, very useful post. Just have to say, there was one trick on our system
(Ubuntu 8.04.3 LTS 64bit, git 1.6.4.4 + git ossi): we are working on mixed
platforms (git/gitosis on linux server and TortoiseGIT client on windows). On
server should be located public keys in format which comes from ssh-keygen
utility. For TortoiseGIT you have to convert private keys from ssh-keygen
generated format to tortoise suitable format. Do it with puttygen.exe, load
private key (generated with ssh-keygen) and save it (key will be the same, but
file format differs). Only after this operation we are able to successfully
access repositories. If both keys was generated directly with puttygen.exe – we
didn’t succeed to connect to repos.

Heike on October 08, 2009 02:43 PM

Thank you for the helpful posting. I aggree with Manu: “Is there a way to
prevent users (who push code) from doing anything beyond pushing code ?” I’m
also looking for. Please help us.

arthur on October 08, 2009 11:48 PM

I’ve suffered from the git clone git@xxx:gitosis-admin.git pwd problem for a
long time.

And tried to add a password for git, but it failed at ‘chdir’ failed problem.

Finally, I remove the password for git, and changed the ssh config file one
line and it works!

The line is, instead of: PasswordAuthentication yes we should:
PasswordAuthentication no

cheers!

Thanks for the tutorial!

Tobias W. on October 13, 2009 04:42 AM

Hi there,

thanks for this tutorial. I got it working after some pain.

Can somebody point me to the explanation of what a ‘bare’ repository is?

I’m trying to setup Redmine to recognize a repository hosted directly or
indirectly by gitosis. To this end, I have tried to follow stu’s instructions.
In /home/scm/git/checkout/project I have the locally cloned repository with a
’.git’ directory inside and the project files.

The directory is world readable, all files are world readable.

Redmine is running through passenger, which is running with the user ‘redmine’
after user-switching.

When I configure the repository path in Redmine and go to the repository, I
still get this message:

“The entry or revision was not found in the repository.”

Any idea?

Andrew M. on October 14, 2009 06:14 AM

I understand that `git push origin master:refs/heads/master’ is specifying the
refspec, but is this necessary? We’ve been using `git push origin master’ here
with no problems, but I’ve been hesitant in suggesting others use this. Is
there something internal to gitosis that requires the refspec to be explicitly
set?

Andrew

Alex on October 14, 2009 10:15 AM

I was experiencing the following error as well:

ERROR:gitosis.serve.main:Repository read access denied fatal: The remote end
hung up unexpectedly

Upon inspecting .gitosis.conf in /home/git I discovered that it wasn’t being
updated to reflect my PUSH.

You MUST update permissions to 755 on the file /home/git/repositories/
gitosis-admin.git/hooks/post-update , otherwise the configuration will not be
updated.

So do that, then modify gitosis.conf so that git picks up the change, commit,
and PUSH again.

This time everything should work!

Matthew on October 21, 2009 11:54 AM

Won’t allowing public access through `—export-all` also give everyone access to
your `gitosis-admin.git` repository? What sort of trouble can come from doing
that?

Everyone will be able to clone all of your public keys, see the configuration
for all your repositories, know that you’re running gitosis. Any of these could
be a weak link in the chain. Is it worth worrying about?

Matias on October 23, 2009 08:53 AM

Wonderful tutorial.

I ran into the same error as Liutauras and after a lot of googling to find a
cached version of http://sk89q.therisenrealm.com/2009/03/fan-of-git/ I applied
the following change that solved it for me:

in run_hook.py

20 try: 21 shutil.rmtree(export) 22 except OSError, e:

becomes

20 try: 21 current_dir = os.getcwd() 22 shutil.rmtree(export) 23 os.chdir
(current_dir) 24 except OSError, e:

It seems it is a bug either in gitosis or, as sk89q says, in python’s
shutil.rmtree. As I am a total analphabet in python I wouldn’t know. I thought
someone else might benefit from this find

matias on October 23, 2009 08:55 AM

Noah on October 23, 2009 01:20 PM

I am using the “owner” attribute of the [repo REPONAME] in gitosis.conf. This
doesn’t appear to affect anything. I was under the impression that the owner
would then be reflected in gitweb.

Note that the description does update correctly.

Michael on October 25, 2009 09:07 AM

This article is almost two years old and also the best guide I found for a
practical implementation of GIT. Thanks.

Leho on October 26, 2009 02:35 PM

Thanks for the setup guide on gitosis, everything worked. Needed to connect
apache basic auth, gitweb and gitosis, wrote up the process here: http://
leho.kraav.com/news/2009/10/27/
using-apache-authentication-with-gitweb-gitosis-repository-access-control/

Also a visit to #git informed of enhanced version of gitosis: http://github.com
/sitaramc/gitolite

Sitaram on October 26, 2009 06:08 PM

just wanted to let people know about gitolite. Gitosis hadn’t seen any updates
for more than a year, I needed “per branch” permissions, including rewind, so I
wrote gitolite. (In perl, in case it matters; I’m not much of a python guy).

Now it has a whole lot of features, not just per branch permissions. A brief
list is in the README at http://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite/blob/pu/README.mkd
and amore detailed list in the “differences from gitosis” section of http://
github.com/sitaramc/gitolite/blob/pu/doc/3-faq-tips-etc.mkd

Much of gitolite’s later evolution was dictated by the constant stream of ssh
problems that I saw on #git; it is now designed to be as painless as possible,
and to be installed entirely from the client side. The idea is that we
front-load the ssh problems—you first get password-less ssh to your server
working (just get a shell) and then you install gitolite from your client.

Leho: I will look at that apache auth thing and see if I can put that in
gitolite; right now I’m working with someone on making it more suitable for
debian packaging but as soon as that is done I’ll try and put this in.

Sitaram on October 26, 2009 09:24 PM

I misunderstood what gitweb auth was in the post above. Seeing the link http://
leho.kraav.com/news/2009/10/27/
using-apache-authentication-with-gitweb-gitosis-repository-access-control/
given made me understand better.

With gitolite this is even easier. Gitolite parses the config file in what I
loosely call a “compile” step when you push a new gitolite config, and the
result of this compile is a pure perl hash that you can just look in to see
who’s allowed to do what.

As you can see in http://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite/blob/pu/doc/
3-faq-tips-etc.mkd#gitwebauth , the actual access control thus reduces to 1
line; the rest is just scaffolding :)

Hello, I was following you guide and it works fine :) Just got a problem when
trying to add a new user to the git. I did as you told, but when the user tries
to clone git@mydomain:project.git it asks for the password of the git user i
think this wasnt supposed to happen right?

I was re-installing gitosis, then I encounted following error.

Like others, I ran into the following error after attempting to push to a new

As it turns out, I misspelled “writable” and “members”. Correcting the spelling
eliminated the error.

There is a very simple way to install setuptools. There is a bootstraping
python script [1] available from Peak. I have a short blog entry [2] about it.

Justin Lilly on January 23, 2010 09:39 PM

I was getting the error

ERROR:gitosis.serve.main:Repository read access denied fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly

which was due to my post-update hook not being fired. If this happens, su into
your git user, then try to run the hook manually. I got some complaints
regarding GIT_DIR. To fix this, I added

GIT_DIR=$HOME/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/

to my git user’s .bashrc which solved it.

gitting it on January 27, 2010 12:31 PM

Great explanation, thanks!

A few things I noticed when using gitosis with Karmic Koala (Ubuntu 9.10), and
using the gitosis setup that results from running ‘apt-get install gitosis’:
instead of the first line twice, as stated in the post. This may be due to my
going through the instructions multiple times (before I figured out the glitch
above). I thought I thoroughly cleaned out the old installation when I
reinstalled, but I might have missed something.

  • Koala doesn’t have git-daemon (or a link to it) in the path. If you wish to
    run it, you have to give the full path: /usr/lib/git-core/git-daemon, or
    establish a link to it somewhere in the path.

This question probably applies however one gets and installs gitosis:

  • git-daemon is just the daemon. Are there scripts available that integrate
    it into a debian-style /etc/init.d/... scheme for easy management?

[Repost, as the first one got munched when it was submitted. Hopefully this one
posts intact.]

Great explanation, thanks!

A few things I noticed when using gitosis with Karmic Koala (Ubuntu 9.10), and
using the gitosis setup that results from running ‘apt-get install gitosis’:

  • the account it installs/runs under is ‘gitosis’, not ‘git’ as in the
    instructions. One has to be careful to use the correct account when typing
    in the commands.

  • when gitosis-init ran, it printed the message

    Initialized empty Git repository in /srv/gitosis/repositories/
    gitosis-admin.git/ Reinitialized existing Git repository in /srv/gitosis/
    repositories/gitosis-admin.git/

instead of the first line twice, as stated in the post. This may be due to my

gitting it on January 28, 2010 12:47 PM

To answer my own question about git-daemon and init-scripts … it seems there is
a git-daemon-run in the Ubuntu repository, but it pulls in a whole new
runlevel-type infrastructure (that seems to sometimes cause problems on some
system) just because one of the developers involved doesn’t like init scripts.

So, like the internet, just route around obstacles. Ignore git-daemon-run and
head over to http://pastie.org/227647 for an init script that seems to work
just fine after some minor and fairly obvious path and account-name tweaking.
For some context on doing this, see

Vincent P on February 12, 2010 10:47 AM

Please help: gitosis-init does not seem to add my laptop public key to the git
account on the repository server at all.

After copying my laptop public key to /tmp on the server, I run the following
command on the server:

sudo -H -u git gitosis-init < /tmp/id_dsa.pub

I get the expected

Reinitialized existing Git repository in /var/gitosis/repositories/
gitosis-admin.git/ Reinitialized existing Git repository in /var/gitosis/
repositories/ gitosis-admin.git/

then I did this: sudo chmod 755 /var/gitosis/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/
hooks/post- update

But when I run the following commands on the server to see if my laptop public
key has been added, it’s not there: sudo ls /var/gitosis/repositories/
gitosis-admin.git/gitosis-export/ keydir sudo gedit /var/gitosis/.ssh/
authorized_keys

I can ssh to the server from the laptop but when I try to git clone
g…@server.local:gitosis-admin.git, I get “Permission denied (publickey)”, which
makes sense because my laptop public key is not in gitosis-export/keydir nor
gitosis/.ssh/authorized_keys.

I suspect that gitosis-init has failed to put my laptop public key in those two
places. What should I do?

Thanks much.

Vincent P on February 12, 2010 11:09 AM

With regard the post above: I spent almost 6 hours on this and a hero named
Ilari on irc://irc.freenode.net/git solved it in 30 seconds. The key is that
gitosis-init works only once. I wish that the manual had pointed that out. The
hero recommended that I check out Gitolite. Thank you !

On Mac OS X Server 10.6 (Snow Leopard) if you encounter an error such as remote
end hung up unexpectedly make sure that the git account can find the
gitosis-serve binary. This might require modifying the git user’s .bashrc file
with the proper path. Also, don’t forget to give the git account remote login
capabilities through system preferences.

adouglas on March 05, 2010 03:59 PM

Great guide. Was having some trouble creating a new git repo, basically geting
a

fatal: ‘gitosis-admin.git’: unable to chdir or not a git archive fatal: The
remote end hung up unexpectedly

and reinstalled everything from scratch. I realized I had encountered the error before but had forgotten where it was coming from. I believe the latest version of gitosis creates a repositories folder, so the instructions are no longer accurate, since you need git clone git@youservername.com/home/git/repositories/gitosis-admin.git

Hope this helps!

Mahesh Vaidya on March 10, 2010 02:22 AM

Hi,

I would like to version control all my server side hooks per repository basis.
Basically I am (trying) to keep all my hooks / repository basis in git admin
repos.

Each time a push is done to gitosis-admin, I would like gitosis post-update
trigger to copy those hooks to respective repository.

Any such feature available ? or way to add extension in gitosis

Thank You -Mahesh Vaidya

Thanks for this introduction! It was a bit easier for me because Debian Lenny
has a gitosis package, though they choose “gitosis” as the username and ”/srv/
gitosis” as the home directory. (Just wanted to point that out for others
reading this article.)

when I setup and run the git clone, I have this error and i finally solved it:

git@xx.xx.xx.xx’s password: fatal: ‘gitosis-admin.git’ does not appear to be a
git repository fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly

the problem was i used the wrong public key to run gitosis-init the first time.
and after i put the correct one there and run the gitosis-init again. it does
not use the new one. and I checked some where on the web said only the ‘initial
user’ can connect and create other users.

So, i remove the /home/git/repositories/gitosis-admin.git folder and run the
gitosis-init again. then it can clone the git.

Roberm Massaioli on April 08, 2010 11:57 PM

This is a really good guide but it could better explain how to setup gitosis
and gitweb together and to that purpose I have created a blog post that
explains how to get gitosis and gitweb running really nicely together. http://
massaioli.homelinux.com/wordpress/2010/04/09/gitweb-and-gitosis-play-nice/

Please take a look at it if you wish to know how to get them both to play
nicely together; hopefully as quickly and painlessly as this really good
tutorial.

jwhendy on April 12, 2010 03:50 PM

I’m having an issue… I set up a bare repo on a windows share to sync my emacs
config stuff. I have a folder with all my files so that I can work from my
desktop or laptop at work and always be covered.

The problem is: - dir called ‘org’ with all my emacs org-mode stuff, an elisp
folder, my .emacs, etc. - dir inside ‘org’ (~/org/elisp/org.git) with the git
of org-mode - have repeatedly done things like ‘git add .’ and ‘commit -a’ from
~/org and even within ~/org/elisp/org.git - no matter what I do, when I clone
to my other computer, org/elisp/org.git is empty. None of the org-mode elisp
files are present as they should. The actual souce is full of files.

I even just repeated this by creating a brand new bare repo, pushed to it… no
luck!

Is there an issue with directories? With git repos inside of git repos? With
folders name x.y (period in the name)?

cisco on April 13, 2010 04:58 PM

Follow the tutorial “exactly”... don’t get creative and it’ll work (took me

followed the tutorial exactly)

devth on April 22, 2010 02:57 PM

Setting this up on a different OSX box after a successful setup on another
machine, I flew thru the tut and skipped the step: sudo chmod 755 /home/git/
repositories/gitosis-admin.git/hooks/post-update

That was a fail because it turns out it wasn’t executable by default. Trying to
add additional users wouldn’t work because of that, and I was receiving the
dreaded “ERROR:gitosis.serve.main:Repository read access denied”. Make sure to
double check that it’s executable!

Cid Dennis on June 01, 2010 01:02 PM

Is there anyway to make only part of a repo accessible by users.

For example

myrepo/project1 myrepo/project2 myrepo/project3

I want a single repo so branchs can span them all but I only want some users
read access to project1 while others have write access to all object while yet
others can only see project3.

I thought it would look like this [group myteam] members = jdoe mike writable =
myrepo

[group myteam-limited1] members = jack readonly = myrepo/project1 writable =
myrepo/project2 myrepo/project3

[group myteam-limited2] members = kim readonly = myrepo/project3

I know I can do this with multiple repos’ but then I lose the ability to branch
them all as a single unit of software.

I was also in touch with

“Repository read access denied”

and in my case the error was thrown because the right key wasn’t in the
ssh-keychain. you can check this with ssh-add -l. if necessary you can add the
right key with ssh-add /root/.ssh/<keyfile>.

Thanks for the wonderful write-up. However I have been stuck up at a particular
point of the configuration.

I have done the server installations, creating ssh key for administrator and
scp’ing it to server, cloning the gitosis-admin repo on the client. Here is
where I get errors.

On the client machine (from where I am remotely administering my git server), I
edited the gitosis.conf file and added a group and a rep section with my
project details.

Then created my project folder, did the following: mkdir my_project cd
my_project git init touch somefile.sh anotherfile.sh git add . git commit -a
git remote add origin git@<server i>:my_project.git git push origin master:refs
/heads/master

[DEL:—output:DEL]— git@172.17.5.216’s password: < I enter the server’s git
user’s password here> and get this error message—> fatal: ‘my_project.git’ does
not appear to be a git repository fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly

I have been breaking my head over this for long, and followed all the steps
correctly upto this point. Why is the command not able to create the
my_project.git repository in my server’s /home/git/repositories folder?

Urgent help appreciated! Thanks,

MoeJoe on June 23, 2010 06:57 AM

A warning for others. I am investigating Git to use at my company. I didn’t
want to pollute our current SCM server, so I used my machine as both the client
and server. Epic fail and frustration. Not certain if it is because of client
and server on the same box, some configuration cruft from past investigations,
or something else. If you are trying gitosis with the same setup and things are
not working, give it up and find another machine to use as a server. Once I put
the server on a different box, things went smooth.

One note to make the discussion easier to follow. There are lots of gits
floating around: git the SCM tool, git the user, git the party mix. It would be
clearer if the git user was called something else, maybe gituser, user, ...

Thanks for the excellent writeup.

Good tutorial, that repository may drive you insane if you are not familiary
with it…

Magnetschmuck on June 23, 2010 08:50 PM

What I cannot do is clone the new repository from any other user that I have
added to the gitosis.conf file. I have checked that the public keys for the
added users are exactly the same on the local machine and in the /home/git/
repositories/gitosis-admin.git/gitosis-export/keydir directory on the server.
The added users have not been added to the /home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys file
(only my admin account is present in this file).

erk on June 25, 2010 03:52 AM

To Magnetschmuck:

Are you sure you did checkout/commit AND push the modifications inside
“gitosis-admin” ?

Marc on June 28, 2010 01:51 PM

Hi

I am trying to get gitosis running on my NAS (Synology) and I am also
experiencing the problem with the password when I try to connect. I tried
cleaning out everything I could find on the Busybox-Linux, recreated new
certificates and so on but all the ideas that were posted here didnt help me.

Anyway, there is always one point different from the tutorial here: when I run
gitosis-init it claims that an existing repository was recreated and I have no
idea where this is coming from.

This is the output

Marvin> sudo -H -u git gitosis-init < /tmp/id_rsa.pub Initialized empty Git
repository in /volume1/homes/git/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/ Reinitialized
existing Git repository in /volume1/homes/git/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/

Any ideas because I ran out of mine? :-) Thanks

Developsigner on July 01, 2010 10:53 AM

the git clone url is borked at eagain.net use http://github.com/res0nat0r/
gitosis.git instead

and http://github.com/res0nat0r/ is the shiznit btw

gdw on July 12, 2010 02:48 PM

I was getting:

ERROR:gitosis.serve.main:Repository read access denied

It seemed to be happening because I had a repo in my gitosis.conf that didn’t
exist. I hope this helps someone. I removed the ‘writable’ line, and it worked.

Gitosis, IMO, is too flakey, but I don’t know if there’s anything better.

Sean on July 25, 2010 12:52 AM

Just thought I’d mention to everyone that the failure “Permission denied (
publickey).” can be caused by an incorrect shell for the ‘git’ user. You do
mention

I fat-fingered the ‘adduser’ command, and the shell ended up being ”/bin/sh/”.
That extra slash at the end was causing some issues. Took a while to figure out
( had to edit /etc/passwd manually ), but once I had it figured out it was a
quick fix. You do mention that “the user does not need a password, but does
need a valid shell (otherwise, SSH will refuse to work)”, but the error message
for getting the shell wrong is a bit misleading.

Kreuzfahrten on July 25, 2010 11:01 AM

Great tutorial, very useful. Thanks for sharing

Nada on July 27, 2010 07:48 AM

@Marc This is not an error. It does initialize it twice

Spyder I had a similar problem and the problem was in my ssh keys. When you
cloned your gitosis-admin repo, did "git clone git
[YOUR_SERVER]:gitosis-admin.git” work, or did you have to do “git clone git@
[YOUR_SERVER]:~/repositories/gitosis-admin.git”? I would suggest starting over
from where you create your ssh keys and initialize gitosis. Clean up the
authorized_keys file as well.

The key is that gitosis-init works only once. I wish that the manual had
pointed that out. The hero recommended that I check out Gitolite. Thank you !

eivanov on August 18, 2010 10:21 AM

I’ve fixed “sh: gitosis-serve: command not found” with modifying /home/git/.ssh
/authorized_keys (gitosis-serve->/usr/local/bin/gitosis-serve for default
PATH). It looks like ssh executes it before ~/.bashrc is read (for non-login
non-interactive shells it’s the only thing which is read).

Futhe Whut on August 29, 2010 12:03 PM

How is having an account without a password on your server “secure?” I don’t
know who started this whole train but having users without passwords is insane.
I just test this and with the git account I could roam all over my server.
Stupid, plain stupid. I locked it down to a few directories and gave it a
password.

neon on August 29, 2010 03:40 PM

I have installed git and gitosis on my gentoo box and seems like everything is
working just fine except one.

I have created repo from desktop and pushed it on server, then I tried to clone
it that way:

git clone git://192.168.1.110:test.git Initialized empty Git repository in /
home/neon/c++/tmp/test/.git/ fatal: Unable to look up (port 9418) (Name or
service not known)

I as you see something is wrong. I have tried second option

git clone git@192.168.1.110:test.git Initialized empty Git repository in /home/
neon/c++/tmp/test/.git/ remote: Counting objects: 6, done. remote: Compressing
objects: 100% (2/2), done. remote: Total 6 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
Receiving objects: 100% (6/6), done.

and it worked, so what’s wrong with git:// ??

desktop and server are on the same subnet, just connected to same router. It
just can’t be dns issue ?

This flags on desktop: emerge -pv git

These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

Calculating dependencies… done! [ebuild R ] dev-vcs/git-1.7.1-r1 USE=
”bash-completion perl subversion -blksha1 -cgi -curl -cvs -doc -emacs -gtk
-iconv (-ppcsha1) -threads -tk -webdav -xinetd” 0 kB

And the server: emerge -pv git gitosis

These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

Calculating dependencies… done! [ebuild R ] dev-vcs/git-1.7.1-r1 USE=
”bash-completion cgi curl cvs doc iconv perl subversion threads webdav -blksha1
-emacs -gtk (-ppcsha1) -tk -xinetd” 0 kB [ebuild R ] dev-vcs/
gitosis-0.2_p20080825 0 kB

I have followed installation from: http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Git http://
en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Gitosis and this site.

Any ideas ? Thanks

Bob Johnson on August 29, 2010 05:52 PM

Can anyone comment to the quality consistency of gitosis (maybe someone who has
been using it for a year +)?

The first time I followed this tutorial I ran into the ‘read access …’ horrible
error (even tho i certainly 755ed the remotepush) , deleted everything, used
bash as the default shell, tried again, and this time got snagged with the
remote add origin not actually doing anything ...

I tried the remote add origin bit a couple more times, and it finally just
worked (I was able to git push). Each time including the success displayed no
message.

I guess I am asking: is this a reliable piece of software? I would be very
hesitant using this for a work project…
