GnuGP

Encryption:

$ gpg -c --cipher-algo AES256 filename

Results in a file called filename.gpg

Decryption:

$ gpg filename.gpg

Mcrypt

In this example I am also using compression.

Encryption with compression:

$ mcrypt -z -a rijndael-256 filename

Decryptation with compression:

$ mcrypt -z -d filename

Se man mcrypt for more information and mcrypt --list for at list of the different supported alghorithems.
OpenSSL

Encryption:

$ openssl aes-256-cbc -e -in filename -out encrypted_filename

Decryption:

$ openssl aes-256-cbc -d -in encrypted_filename -out filename
